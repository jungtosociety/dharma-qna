1
00:00:03,736 --> 00:00:07,866
I am sensitive to my child's school grades

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,345
(Questioner) I enjoyed your appearance 
on the TV show 'Healing Camp'.

3
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:15,285
(Questioner) I also read your book 
'A Monk's Wedding Speech'.

4
00:00:15,285 --> 00:00:20,555
(Questioner) It made me think about many 
things and brings me here today.

5
00:00:20,555 --> 00:00:23,095
I have a daughter who just 
entered elementary school.

6
00:00:23,095 --> 00:00:29,475
I know study itself and good grade 
doesn't mean that she'll have a good life.

7
00:00:29,475 --> 00:00:33,525
However, I still get nervous 
and stressed out.

8
00:00:33,538 --> 00:00:37,768
At first, I thought it would be fine 
for her to rank in the middle.

9
00:00:37,768 --> 00:00:41,442
Still, I had convinced myself that 
even if she ranks last in class,

10
00:00:41,442 --> 00:00:43,462
it would be okay.
Despite of this thought,

11
00:00:43,462 --> 00:00:46,372
I am getting irritated at her
mistake in her exam, even one

12
00:00:46,372 --> 00:00:51,032
I get overly sensitive 
and scold her with anger.

13
00:00:51,032 --> 00:00:52,297
Sometimes I wonder,

14
00:00:52,297 --> 00:00:56,287
Do I want her to study for herself 
or for the sake of my own pride

15
00:00:56,287 --> 00:01:01,047
Even knowing this, I can't 
easily let go. What should I do?

16
00:01:01,047 --> 00:01:03,467
(Sunim) You just raised a question.

17
00:01:03,467 --> 00:01:05,627
Do you want her to study 
for her own sake?

18
00:01:05,627 --> 00:01:07,997
Or should she study for
your own pride?

19
00:01:07,997 --> 00:01:09,347
(Sunim) Are you confused?

20
00:01:09,347 --> 00:01:10,877
(Questioner) Yes, I'm not sure.

21
00:01:10,877 --> 00:01:12,437
(Sunim) Think more about it.

22
00:01:12,437 --> 00:01:13,907
(Questioner) Maybe I think,

23
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:19,957
(Questioner) I try not to see 
other moms too often.

24
00:01:19,957 --> 00:01:24,256
(Questioner) Because, they say 
someone's child received an award,

25
00:01:24,256 --> 00:01:27,055
(Questioner) or someone's child
got praised by the teacher.

26
00:01:27,055 --> 00:01:30,315
(Questioner) However, what I have 
heard the most was that..

27
00:01:30,315 --> 00:01:37,565
(Questioner) my daughter had fought 
with a friend and got punished.

28
00:01:38,088 --> 00:01:41,018
(Questioner) I'd be OK not to 
hear and know that,

29
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:43,978
(Questioner) or hear it from 
my daughter directly,

30
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:48,668
(Questioner) But hearing such 
things from others made me upset.

31
00:01:48,668 --> 00:01:52,464
(Sunim) If she had hit 
someone or had fought,

32
00:01:52,464 --> 00:01:57,514
(Sunim) those behaviors 
should be corrected.

33
00:01:57,514 --> 00:01:59,474
(Sunim) But think of it this way.

34
00:01:59,474 --> 00:02:02,594
(Sunim) Let say, we select 
30 top-performing students,

35
00:02:02,594 --> 00:02:04,264
(Sunim) and put them in one class.

36
00:02:04,264 --> 00:02:06,772
(Sunim) Do they have 
the last-placed student or not?

37
00:02:06,772 --> 00:02:08,362
(Questioner) Yes, they have one

38
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:11,042
(Sunim) If we made a classroom 
of 30 worst performing students.

39
00:02:11,042 --> 00:02:12,562
(Sunim) Is there a 
first-placed one or not?

40
00:02:12,562 --> 00:02:13,472
(Questioner) Yes

41
00:02:13,472 --> 00:02:17,002
(Sunim) Rankings are not that important.

42
00:02:17,002 --> 00:02:22,062
(Sunim) If you want your child to rank
higher, you should move to the suburbs.

43
00:02:23,008 --> 00:02:27,258
When you move to the suburbs, 
she'll immediately rank higher.

44
00:02:27,262 --> 00:02:31,912
Rankings are not meaningful at all.

45
00:02:31,912 --> 00:02:35,836
And children make mistakes.
If you give her pressure,

46
00:02:35,836 --> 00:02:38,585
she makes a mistake even
though she knows the answer.

47
00:02:38,585 --> 00:02:41,325
When you are nervous, 
you can't speak very well.

48
00:02:41,325 --> 00:02:44,205
When you tremble, it is hard to 
speak out in front of people.

49
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:47,905
We all know how is like taking exam.

50
00:02:47,905 --> 00:02:50,535
When you're nervous, 
you got wrong answer by mistake

51
00:02:50,535 --> 00:02:51,915
The question asks you 
to pick the wrong answer,

52
00:02:51,915 --> 00:03:02,435
but you pick the very first right
answer and you move on.

53
00:03:02,435 --> 00:03:06,261
You thought you were supposed 
to pick the right one.

54
00:03:06,261 --> 00:03:09,138
Later, you find out you read 
the question in apposite way,

55
00:03:09,138 --> 00:03:14,058
So, choose right one instead of 
wrong one by mistake

56
00:03:14,058 --> 00:03:18,514
The more nervous you are, 
the more likely this happens.

57
00:03:18,514 --> 00:03:24,837
If your child comes home 
upset over her grades,

58
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:27,347
a mother should pat her 
daughter's back and say,

59
00:03:27,347 --> 00:03:33,327
"It's fine. It's ok, getting one more
right answer doesn't affect your life"

60
00:03:33,327 --> 00:03:38,971
"If you didn't do well this time, 
you can do better next time."

61
00:03:38,971 --> 00:03:42,969
A mother should encourage her child,

62
00:03:42,969 --> 00:03:46,671
instead of jumping up and down, 
even more so than your own child.

63
00:03:46,671 --> 00:03:49,551
You're not sensitive 
for the sake of your child.

64
00:03:49,551 --> 00:03:52,761
but for your own pride and satisfaction.

65
00:03:52,761 --> 00:03:56,287
Likewise, there is a same feeling 
when you speak to other parents.

66
00:03:56,287 --> 00:04:00,017
Your pride gets hurt,
not for your child.

67
00:04:00,017 --> 00:04:02,837
You want them to say your 
child is smart and a good kid.

68
00:04:02,837 --> 00:04:06,397
but your expectations aren't met.

69
00:04:06,397 --> 00:04:11,598
A mother should always protect her child
no matter how she gets criticized.

70
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:15,597
A child is not a puppy nor a possession.

71
00:04:17,078 --> 00:04:21,048
Let say, someone give you
compliments to your clothes.

72
00:04:21,048 --> 00:04:24,452
Are they praising you 
or your clothes?

73
00:04:24,452 --> 00:04:27,432
It is the same logic.

74
00:04:27,877 --> 00:04:30,767
The things is you want to hear that 
you're a good person.

75
00:04:30,767 --> 00:04:33,387
It's not important to hear that 
your clothes are nice,

76
00:04:33,387 --> 00:04:35,687
or that your hair looks gorgeous.

77
00:04:35,687 --> 00:04:39,556
Please stop worthless thinking,

78
00:04:39,556 --> 00:04:43,929
Mother always should be a protector
and the God to her children.

79
00:04:43,929 --> 00:04:46,569
Children should know 
their mother will protect them,

80
00:04:46,569 --> 00:04:48,099
when the world may harm them

81
00:04:48,099 --> 00:04:50,679
They should know that 
the world may criticize them,

82
00:04:50,679 --> 00:04:53,589
but their mother will still love them.

83
00:04:53,589 --> 00:05:00,020
Only when they feel this way, 
they won't long for love.

84
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:03,066
Most of you don't nurture 
your children this way.

85
00:05:03,066 --> 00:05:07,426
Hence, children always feel the lack 
of love. You may have felt this way too.

86
00:05:07,426 --> 00:05:13,746
As people seek love, they fall in love to 
anyone who give you good cares.

87
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:16,508
That's why they easily got fraud.

88
00:05:16,508 --> 00:05:22,490
Women who long for love easily 
fall in love with players and frauds.

89
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:25,830
Someone shows a little attention, 
they trust and give herself to them.

90
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:29,416
They lack of objectivity 
and seeing people.

91
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:33,266
Hence, they lead their own 
children into unhappiness.

92
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:37,426
Keep your child preciously.

93
00:05:37,426 --> 00:05:41,876
I'm not saying you should think it's fine
for her to be the lowest in the class.

94
00:05:41,876 --> 00:05:45,184
Regardless of the lowest or the highest,

95
00:05:45,184 --> 00:05:51,064
you should encourage her and let her 
know you love her as her mother.

96
00:05:51,064 --> 00:05:53,183
If she fails this time,

97
00:05:53,183 --> 00:05:56,783
you should encourage her 
to challenge herself next time.

98
00:05:56,924 --> 00:06:00,674
If she fails again, you should 
encourage her once again.

99
00:06:00,674 --> 00:06:03,024
Children may give up and despair,

100
00:06:03,024 --> 00:06:08,504
but they can comeback for 
encouragement of their mother.

101
00:06:08,504 --> 00:06:10,793
Don't be stick to class ranking.

102
00:06:10,793 --> 00:06:17,863
Teachers may worry about rankings, 
but mothers should not.

103
00:06:18,501 --> 00:06:21,211
You should change your way of thinking.

104
00:06:21,211 --> 00:06:27,211
How are you with your husband? 
Are you good to him?

105
00:06:27,211 --> 00:06:30,218
While they are cling to such 
unnecessary anxiety on her child,

106
00:06:30,218 --> 00:06:34,208
It is hard to see good wives 
for the husbands.

107
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:35,798
(Sunim) I can tell.

108
00:06:35,798 --> 00:06:41,658
Wives in an amazing relationship with
their husbands focus less on their kids.

109
00:06:41,658 --> 00:06:47,058
When the relationship is not satisfied, 
they focus on their children.

110
00:06:47,058 --> 00:06:52,948
So, let your child go and focus 
more on your husband. Okay?

111
00:06:52,948 --> 00:06:56,208
You should be good to your
husband from now on,

112
00:06:56,208 --> 00:07:00,048
doing 108 prostrations every morning.

113
00:07:00,048 --> 00:07:02,408
Even if you change your mind,

114
00:07:02,408 --> 00:07:04,168
you'll likely feel sensitive again
when you see you child.

115
00:07:04,168 --> 00:07:05,348
Do you understand?

116
00:07:05,348 --> 00:07:06,117
(Questioner) Yes

117
00:07:06,117 --> 00:07:09,998
You have to do 
108 prostrations continuously

118
00:07:09,998 --> 00:07:15,647
Saying "Buddha, my child grow up well.
I have no worries."

119
00:07:15,809 --> 00:07:20,569
Mothers should be positive 
towards their children.

120
00:07:20,569 --> 00:07:27,107
If a mother always nags and 
treats her child as problematic,

121
00:07:27,107 --> 00:07:29,887
how can a child develop 
self-esteem?

122
00:07:29,887 --> 00:07:34,888
They become insecure and consider 
themselves unworthy and not good enough.

123
00:07:34,888 --> 00:07:43,398
A child's self-respect breaks down if 
a mother criticizes her child constantly

124
00:07:43,398 --> 00:07:48,751
When child grows, they resist.
Please stop bothering your child.

125
00:07:48,751 --> 00:07:53,949
If you have nothing to do, go out 
and do your own thing. Play with a dog.

126
00:07:53,949 --> 00:07:58,799
Don't bother your child, 
Just encourage her.

127
00:07:58,799 --> 00:08:01,181
I will. Thank you.

128
00:08:04,601 --> 00:08:06,161
If you have seven or eight kids,

129
00:08:06,161 --> 00:08:10,661
do you think you have time to 
be worry on those issues? No

130
00:08:10,661 --> 00:08:13,903
Since you have an only child, 
you are fussing over her.

131
00:08:13,903 --> 00:08:16,873
If you have a work or 
if you are satisfied your relationship,

132
00:08:16,873 --> 00:08:19,813
you would spend more time with 
your husband than your child.

133
00:08:19,813 --> 00:08:23,153
But You're not satisfied with your 
husband, you have an only child,

134
00:08:23,153 --> 00:08:24,923
So, you are obsessed with your child.

135
00:08:24,923 --> 00:08:26,973
You dress a child in this one and that one

136
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:28,883
you feed her this one and that one.

137
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,483
You follow her school and
ask to do this and do that.

138
00:08:31,483 --> 00:08:35,195
How should this little child endure this?
