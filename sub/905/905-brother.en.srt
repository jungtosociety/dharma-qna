00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,330
Ever Since My Brother Passed Away, I Have Felt Lonely

2
00:00:07,573 --> 00:00:08,373
(Questioner) Hello, Sunim.

3
00:00:08,373 --> 00:00:08,725
Hello.

4
00:00:08,851 --> 00:00:13,031
(Questioner) I'm a 15-year-old student.

5
00:00:13,042 --> 00:00:16,592
My brother passed away last year.

6
00:00:16,671 --> 00:00:18,041
Out of everyone in my family,

7
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:25,541
I talked to my brother the most, 
and we had so much in common.

8
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:30,201
We were very close, at least in my mind.

9
00:00:30,201 --> 00:00:34,891
But now that he passed away, 
I'm often all alone at home.

10
00:00:34,962 --> 00:00:40,512
I can no longer ask him 
for advice or stories.

11
00:00:40,518 --> 00:00:45,718
I can no longer joke around with him. 
It makes me feel so lonely.

12
00:00:45,718 --> 00:00:50,926
Right after his death,
I started getting counseling.

13
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:54,119
And I also openly communicate 
with my family,

14
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:57,709
so I thought I would feel 
better eventually.

15
00:00:57,709 --> 00:00:59,638
But as time passes by,

16
00:00:59,638 --> 00:01:03,948
I always wonder how things would be 
different if my brother were around.

17
00:01:03,954 --> 00:01:09,164
I wonder if I would have been stronger
and happier with him around.

18
00:01:09,164 --> 00:01:14,726
There's no reason I shouldn't 
be thinking of him, is there?

19
00:01:14,726 --> 00:01:21,984
So I wonder whether I should continue to 
live my life longing for my dead brother.

20
00:01:23,162 --> 00:01:33,282
I see. Let's give this student a round 
of applause for encouragement. (Applause)

21
00:01:34,963 --> 00:01:40,375
When you're parting with a friend,

22
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:44,225
if you keep crying and 
don't let go of her hands, saying,

23
00:01:44,227 --> 00:01:49,927
"Oh, what am I supposed to do 
without you? I'm going to miss you!"

24
00:01:49,927 --> 00:01:51,501
Can the friend leave you swiftly?

25
00:01:51,501 --> 00:01:55,891
She would have trouble 
leaving you, wouldn't she?

26
00:01:55,892 --> 00:02:02,042
I fully understand how saddened 
you are of losing your brother.

27
00:02:02,045 --> 00:02:08,285
But you keep longing for him
and wishing he were alive.

28
00:02:08,285 --> 00:02:13,351
Let's say that your brother's soul 
lives on in the afterlife.

29
00:02:13,351 --> 00:02:18,351
We can't prove whether 
soul exists or not, can we?

30
00:02:18,361 --> 00:02:19,774
(Questioner) 
Perhaps it exists.

31
00:02:19,774 --> 00:02:25,844
(Sunim) Nobody can say that for sure. 
But we generally believe that it exists.

32
00:02:25,844 --> 00:02:31,604
Assuming that it exists, could you call 
him back after he had already died?

33
00:02:31,604 --> 00:02:32,990
No, I couldn't.

34
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,814
According to the Buddhist thought,

35
00:02:35,814 --> 00:02:41,044
your brother would be reborn
as a different being. Right?

36
00:02:41,044 --> 00:02:41,454
Yes.

37
00:02:41,454 --> 00:02:45,314
According to the Christian thought,
he would go to heaven.

38
00:02:45,314 --> 00:02:45,574
(Questioner) Yes.

39
00:02:45,574 --> 00:02:47,474
Or go to the Buddhist heaven.

40
00:02:47,474 --> 00:02:48,684
(Questioner) Yes.

41
00:02:48,694 --> 00:02:51,194
Should he not go there and live happily?

42
00:02:51,194 --> 00:02:53,584
Or should he remain as a ghost 
and wander around?

43
00:02:53,584 --> 00:02:54,514
He should live happily.

44
00:02:54,514 --> 00:02:55,884
Yes, he should.

45
00:02:55,884 --> 00:03:00,604
Then, can he do that if you keep longing
for him and calling out to him?

46
00:03:00,604 --> 00:03:01,755
No, he can't.

47
00:03:01,755 --> 00:03:05,754
He can neither leave nor stay. 
What does that make of him?

48
00:03:05,754 --> 00:03:12,864
He would become a lonely, wandering soul.

49
00:03:12,864 --> 00:03:19,431
Then who made him become 
that lonely, wandering soul?

50
00:03:19,431 --> 00:03:20,380
Me?

51
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:29,250
Yes. You can miss him all you want, 
but you can't make your brother suffer.

52
00:03:30,601 --> 00:03:36,891
If he becomes a lonely soul, 
he will suffer too much.

53
00:03:39,037 --> 00:03:40,147
(Questioner) I see.

54
00:03:40,633 --> 00:03:46,993
You are free to miss him, but you have 
no right to cause him suffering.

55
00:03:49,451 --> 00:03:52,231
But I can still think of him, right?

56
00:03:52,231 --> 00:03:56,791
(Sunim) You can, but if you do, 
he can't leave you.

57
00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:05,889
You can yearn for him, it's your choice.

58
00:04:05,889 --> 00:04:09,339
For example, when you're 
parting ways with a friend,

59
00:04:09,339 --> 00:04:13,549
you could hold onto her and sob, right?

60
00:04:13,566 --> 00:04:16,966
But if you do that, can 
your friend leave you or not?

61
00:04:16,966 --> 00:04:17,986
(Questioner) She can't.

62
00:04:17,986 --> 00:04:22,279
No, she can't. Even if the friend leaves, 
how would she feel leaving you?

63
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:24,179
She'd feel bad.

64
00:04:24,179 --> 00:04:27,311
It's understandable that 
I will miss my friend,

65
00:04:27,311 --> 00:04:30,091
but would it help my friend 
if I hold on to her?

66
00:04:30,091 --> 00:04:30,963
(Questioner) No, it wouldn't.

67
00:04:30,963 --> 00:04:31,663
Correct.

68
00:04:31,663 --> 00:04:37,053
Now you understand that what you're doing 
doesn't help your brother in any way.

69
00:04:37,053 --> 00:04:39,822
It's only making him suffer.

70
00:04:41,762 --> 00:04:46,562
(Questioner) I see. 
Then should I just suffer?

71
00:04:46,562 --> 00:04:52,612
No, you shouldn't suffer. You need 
to let him go as soon as possible.

72
00:04:54,042 --> 00:04:55,652
When you part ways with a friend,

73
00:04:55,652 --> 00:04:57,952
if the friend keeps looking back 
to you, what do you say?

74
00:04:57,952 --> 00:05:02,412
You say, "hey, we can see 
each other again. So go. Go now."

75
00:05:02,412 --> 00:05:08,386
When we leave someone, we tell those 
we leave behind to go back inside quickly.

76
00:05:08,386 --> 00:05:11,982
And the other person says,
"don't look back, just go!"

77
00:05:11,982 --> 00:05:14,052
In the same way, what should 
you say to your brother?

78
00:05:14,052 --> 00:05:17,452
"Farewell my brother, 
have a safe journey."

79
00:05:17,452 --> 00:05:20,654
"Bye, brother." That's it.

80
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:23,714
That's how you can help your brother.

81
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:30,710
Would you prefer to send 
your brother to heaven?

82
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:34,050
Or would you rather have him remain 
a ghost wandering by your side?

83
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:35,860
I'd want him to go to heaven.

84
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,760
Then what should you do?

85
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,140
You should let go of him right now.

86
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,940
You need to cut him off from your thoughts.

87
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:46,290
Tell him, "Goodbye, brother," 
and let him go.

88
00:05:49,553 --> 00:05:52,013
Will you keep hanging 
onto him for your sake?

89
00:05:52,013 --> 00:05:54,323
Or will you let him go for his sake?

90
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:55,845
(Questioner) I should let him go.

91
00:05:55,845 --> 00:05:57,945
Then say it here now.

92
00:05:57,945 --> 00:06:00,285
Try saying, "Bye-bye, brother." Now.

93
00:06:00,285 --> 00:06:02,025
Bye-bye, brother.

94
00:06:02,025 --> 00:06:02,905
(Sunim) Bye-bye.

95
00:06:02,905 --> 00:06:03,615
Bye-bye.

96
00:06:03,681 --> 00:06:07,681
No, you're saying that against your will.

97
00:06:09,357 --> 00:06:13,403
You're saying it because I'm 
telling you to. Say it like you mean it.

98
00:06:13,403 --> 00:06:17,543
Say, "Goodbye, my brother," 
and let that be it.

99
00:06:19,989 --> 00:06:22,219
(Questioner) Goodbye, brother.

100
00:06:22,219 --> 00:06:24,839
No, not like that.

101
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:30,069
It's as if you're saying, 
"Farewell, but do come back."

102
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:34,063
It's like you're saying, "no, thank you," 
but taking it at the same time.

103
00:06:34,263 --> 00:06:40,563
You're saying farewell, but you're telling
him, "how can I live without you?!"

104
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:41,927
That's not a good send-off.

105
00:06:41,927 --> 00:06:46,217
Say it cheerfully, "Farewell, my brother."

106
00:06:46,982 --> 00:06:48,642
(Questioner) Goodbye, brother.

107
00:06:48,642 --> 00:06:50,975
Do you feel like you let him go?

108
00:06:52,075 --> 00:06:54,535
(Questioner) Ah, I don't know.

109
00:06:54,535 --> 00:06:57,215
Try it again. Let him go.

110
00:06:57,215 --> 00:06:59,535
Really do it for his sake. Truly.

111
00:06:59,535 --> 00:07:01,190
(Questioner) Do I really 
have to do it here?

112
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:07,570
Yes. Even if you do it here, you'll 
think of him again when you go home.

113
00:07:07,574 --> 00:07:11,874
But if you can't do it here, then you 
definitely won't be able to do it at home.

114
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,500
(Questioner) Goodbye, brother.

115
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,000
You didn't mean that at the end.

116
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:23,600
You were doing it well, 
then you were about to cry.

117
00:07:23,684 --> 00:07:26,888
Say it in a clean, light way. 
"Farewell, brother."

118
00:07:26,888 --> 00:07:30,808
Watch me say it. "Farewell, brother."

119
00:07:32,163 --> 00:07:36,053
But you can't do it right now. 
Try it again.

120
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:40,899
(Questioner) Farewell, brother.

121
00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:46,129
Oh my. Why keep holding 
onto him like that?

122
00:07:46,129 --> 00:07:48,459
Say, "Farewell, brother. Goodbye."

123
00:07:48,459 --> 00:07:51,759
(Questioner) Just go already, brother.

124
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:03,645
You don't really like 
your brother, do you?

125
00:08:03,645 --> 00:08:05,706
If you really like him, 
you should let him go.

126
00:08:05,706 --> 00:08:08,996
Did he bother you much when he was alive?

127
00:08:08,996 --> 00:08:10,136
(Questioner) No, he didn't.

128
00:08:10,136 --> 00:08:14,296
Are you not intentionally trying to get 
back at him for bothering you before?

129
00:08:14,296 --> 00:08:17,909
If your brother was so good to you, 
you should also be good to him.

130
00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:20,779
You should let him go, "Bye-bye brother."

131
00:08:22,529 --> 00:08:30,889
(Questioner) Goodbye, brother! 
Really this time. (Applause)

132
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:34,714
I would be nice of you 
to let him go here right now,

133
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:37,724
but I don't think you're 
even halfway there.

134
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:43,016
You can't let go with a tone like that.

135
00:08:43,016 --> 00:08:45,727
You should really try letting 
him go. Do you understand?

136
00:08:45,727 --> 00:08:45,977
(Questioner) Yes.

137
00:08:45,977 --> 00:08:49,277
Only when you let him go can he 
really move on to a good place.

138
00:08:49,277 --> 00:08:52,021
What can you do now to help him do that?

139
00:08:52,021 --> 00:08:56,291
Isn't it your duty to make sure 
he moves on to a nice place?

140
00:08:56,309 --> 00:08:56,729
(Questioner) Yes.

141
00:08:56,729 --> 00:08:58,729
Are you trying to send 
him off to a bad place?

142
00:08:58,729 --> 00:08:59,999
(Questioner) No, I am not.

143
00:08:59,999 --> 00:09:05,469
Of course not. He can't move on 
if you keep holding onto him.

144
00:09:05,469 --> 00:09:09,318
But if you can cheerfully bid him
farewell, you can let him go.

145
00:09:09,318 --> 00:09:12,837
Once you truly let him go, 
it's ok to think of him.

146
00:09:13,047 --> 00:09:14,087
Do you understanding?

147
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:17,797
There's a difference between 
remembering him and longing for him.

148
00:09:17,861 --> 00:09:20,071
Remembering him is fine.

149
00:09:20,191 --> 00:09:24,611
But you shouldn't long for him. 
That's wanting to bring him back.

150
00:09:24,681 --> 00:09:32,621
(Questioner) In the past, I didn't cry 
very much thinking of him.

151
00:09:32,621 --> 00:09:41,111
Even until the middle of 
this year, I felt okay.

152
00:09:41,111 --> 00:09:46,081
But after counseling and starting school 
again, it has been difficult to control.

153
00:09:46,088 --> 00:09:48,558
I see. If you can't control your feelings,
your brother can't move on.

154
00:09:48,558 --> 00:09:52,795
And you will fall into 
depression eventually.

155
00:09:52,795 --> 00:09:55,305
Your mother will worry about you.

156
00:09:55,305 --> 00:10:00,555
Who is sadder for losing him--you or your mom?

157
00:10:00,731 --> 00:10:03,071
Mom is sadder.

158
00:10:03,071 --> 00:10:10,411
Then, you should bid him farewell and 
encourage your mom to let him go.

159
00:10:10,411 --> 00:10:12,595
If you're crying every day for him,

160
00:10:12,595 --> 00:10:16,315
your already sad mom becomes 
even more miserable.

161
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:18,900
I've never talked about this anywhere.

162
00:10:19,069 --> 00:10:21,789
(Sunim) You should let him go.

163
00:10:21,789 --> 00:10:24,309
(Sunim) You need to feel 
happy again, okay?

164
00:10:24,309 --> 00:10:26,429
(Questioner) Okay.

165
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:29,629
Try smiling.

166
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,899
I laugh easily.

167
00:10:32,657 --> 00:10:37,357
You're suppressing your 
sorrow. Let all of it go.

168
00:10:37,361 --> 00:10:38,211
(Questioner) Yes.

169
00:10:38,211 --> 00:10:44,115
Starting today, do 108 prostrations daily,
and pray for your brother for 100 days.

170
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:49,830
Every time you prostrate, say, 
"Goodbye, brother." Do that 108 times.

171
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:52,800
How? "Farewell, my brother." "Goodbye."

172
00:10:52,837 --> 00:10:57,447
Do this as you prostrate 108 times.

173
00:10:57,447 --> 00:10:57,827
(Questioner) Okay.

174
00:10:57,827 --> 00:11:01,557
If you do it for 100 days, 
he'll really move on to a good place.

175
00:11:01,557 --> 00:11:05,237
(Questioner) My brother was Catholic.

176
00:11:05,238 --> 00:11:09,688
Then, where will he go? 
He'll end up in heaven, won't he?

177
00:11:09,697 --> 00:11:10,897
(Questioner) Yes.

178
00:11:11,067 --> 00:11:13,817
You said he'll go to heaven.

179
00:11:13,847 --> 00:11:15,777
I didn't say where he should go.

180
00:11:15,777 --> 00:11:18,507
What did I say? I said you should 
wish him to go to a good place.

181
00:11:18,507 --> 00:11:19,514
(Questioner) Yes.

182
00:11:20,278 --> 00:11:22,268
If he's Christian, he'll go to 
Christian heaven.

183
00:11:22,268 --> 00:11:25,028
If he's Buddhist, he'll go to 
Buddhist heaven.

184
00:11:25,028 --> 00:11:27,008
Each one has his or her own path.

185
00:11:27,008 --> 00:11:29,678
Where he goes is not 
that important to you.

186
00:11:29,678 --> 00:11:31,828
What's important is that 
he goes where he wants to go.

187
00:11:31,828 --> 00:11:33,738
Not where you'd like him to go.

188
00:11:33,738 --> 00:11:34,658
Wherever it is that he wants to go,

189
00:11:34,658 --> 00:11:37,478
he should go to a good place and quickly.
Do you understand?

190
00:11:37,478 --> 00:11:40,248
(Questioner) Yes, thank you.
