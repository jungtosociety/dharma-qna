00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:20,750
How Should I Write My Practice Journal?

2
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:27,431
Thank you so much for 
your wonderful Dharma talks.

3
00:00:27,431 --> 00:00:32,427
I start my day with practice 
first thing in the morning.

4
00:00:32,427 --> 00:00:37,774
It is not easy because it is very early,

5
00:00:37,774 --> 00:00:41,579
but what I find even more difficult is 
keep writing a practice journal.

6
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:45,035
For practice, I do 108 prostrations 
with words of prayer,

7
00:00:45,035 --> 00:00:48,776
then read the Jungto practice manual.

8
00:00:48,776 --> 00:00:54,139
But when I sit down 
to write a practice journal,

9
00:00:54,139 --> 00:00:57,654
I don’t know what to write

10
00:00:57,654 --> 00:01:03,478
because I feel pretty much 
the same way every day.

11
00:01:03,478 --> 00:01:10,415
Can you please advise me 
how to write in my practice journal?

12
00:01:14,645 --> 00:01:24,630
I wonder if you are little spaced out
when you practice,

13
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:31,848
Maybe you are out of focus
when you do prostration.

14
00:01:31,848 --> 00:01:39,879
Let's say your prayer for the practice
is “My husband is Buddha”

15
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:46,219
Or “I will say yes and 
accept my husband words.”

16
00:01:46,219 --> 00:01:53,067
When you do prostrations repeating 
'I will say yes and accepting his words'

17
00:01:53,067 --> 00:02:01,936
However, sometimes you were aware 
you didn't say yes to him

18
00:02:01,936 --> 00:02:05,981
and didn't accept his words.

19
00:02:05,981 --> 00:02:10,457
“When my husband said something to me,

20
00:02:10,457 --> 00:02:15,086
I shouted ‘no’ at him 
instead of saying ‘yes’."

21
00:02:15,086 --> 00:02:18,975
I insisted that I was right.

22
00:02:18,975 --> 00:02:21,966
“My husband is Buddha” means

23
00:02:21,966 --> 00:02:27,623
the same as I will say “yes” 
and yield to him.

24
00:02:27,623 --> 00:02:32,259
If your husband were actually Buddha, 
you would say yes to him, right?

25
00:02:32,259 --> 00:02:37,207
You wouldn’t say, 
“No, Buddha, that is not right!” Correct?

26
00:02:37,207 --> 00:02:39,889
If Buddha says something to you, 
you would say,

27
00:02:39,889 --> 00:02:43,514
“Oh, right, right. I will do as you said”
without any internal resistance.

28
00:02:43,514 --> 00:02:45,826
So “My husband is Buddha” means that

29
00:02:45,826 --> 00:02:51,941
you will accept whatever your husband 
says without any internal resistance.

30
00:02:51,941 --> 00:02:56,236
You accept the Buddha’s words
unconditionally, don’t you?

31
00:02:56,236 --> 00:02:58,604
But just because you accept 
every word from Buddha

32
00:02:58,604 --> 00:03:02,007
Can you actually do everything 
he tells you to do? No.

33
00:03:02,007 --> 00:03:04,769
When you can’t carry out his teachings,

34
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:09,340
What do you do? You repent, right?

35
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:13,688
In the same way, even if you accept 
whatever your husband tells you,

36
00:03:18,389 --> 00:03:23,015
it doesn’t mean you do what he wants every time.

37
00:03:23,015 --> 00:03:26,846
You probably can’t do more than what you think you can do.

38
00:03:26,846 --> 00:03:29,886
Then, why should I say 
'yes' although I can't complete it

39
00:03:29,886 --> 00:03:30,956
That’s not the point.

40
00:03:30,956 --> 00:03:34,259
You would say yes because your intention
is to accept him at that moment.

41
00:03:34,259 --> 00:03:36,978
However, you find it is very 
difficult and not doable.

42
00:03:36,978 --> 00:03:42,779
Then, again, you repent 
saying 'I am sorry'

43
00:03:42,779 --> 00:03:52,656
If you keep practicing it every day,
you recognize the moment you say 'no' to him

44
00:03:52,656 --> 00:04:02,009
and you change your words 
to 'yes, I will do it' immediately.

45
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:06,676
Practicing more and more, you can 
hold your words before speaking out

46
00:04:06,676 --> 00:04:12,835
and remind your prayer words are 
saying yes, and you will say it to him.

47
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:17,100
This is the practice and how it works.

48
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:23,385
Realizing and repenting what you did 
is not passing a day

49
00:04:23,385 --> 00:04:24,626
How about now?

50
00:04:24,626 --> 00:04:30,028
Our habit of saying 'no' continues for 
10 years, 20 years or even 30 years.

51
00:04:30,028 --> 00:04:32,570
We continue to blame others 
for creating problems for us.

52
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:37,046
This is why you are 
feeling so heavy and stifling.

53
00:04:40,026 --> 00:04:44,978
So, repent for your reply in the past.

54
00:04:44,978 --> 00:04:54,891
It became your habit and you keep 
saying 'no' when the situation happens

55
00:04:54,891 --> 00:05:02,715
Don’t be caught up in your 
thoughts for more than a day.

56
00:05:02,715 --> 00:05:08,027
When you practice in the morning,
look back yesterday and tell yourself,

57
00:05:08,027 --> 00:05:12,136
'I insisted on my opinion, and I missed 
my words for practice that moment.

58
00:05:12,136 --> 00:05:15,526
Then, writing your practice journal
becomes simple and easy.

59
00:05:15,526 --> 00:05:20,276
"Yesterday, when my husband 
said something, I said 'no', and

60
00:05:20,276 --> 00:05:25,987
I realized that I forgot my prayer words 
during the practice, 108 prostration.

61
00:05:25,987 --> 00:05:32,777
The moment I realized it, that's not 
bothering me and I felt so much better."

62
00:05:32,777 --> 00:05:35,817
This is the way you can write the journal.

63
00:05:35,817 --> 00:05:38,758
How can it be the same every day?

64
00:05:38,758 --> 00:05:40,996
I don't understand it.

65
00:05:40,996 --> 00:05:44,858
It can be the same everyday 
only if you are focused out and dumb.

66
00:05:44,858 --> 00:05:47,347
If you are dumb and 
can’t think of anything

67
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:51,197
that means, It was stupid yesterday, 
stupid today, and stupid tomorrow

68
00:05:51,197 --> 00:05:54,066
This is the only case that 
can be the same every day.

69
00:05:54,066 --> 00:05:58,790
Don’t force yourself to come up with
something to write in your journal.

70
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:05,157
Thoughts arise naturally during bowing 
if you focus on your words for practice.

71
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:08,907
This and that kind of thoughts come up

72
00:06:08,907 --> 00:06:12,687
It could be just one thought, 
could be several thoughts.

73
00:06:12,687 --> 00:06:16,856
If you really had no thought,

74
00:06:16,856 --> 00:06:21,111
you can just write down “No thoughts 
or emotions during my practice today.”

75
00:06:21,111 --> 00:06:23,744
What if nothing comes up
in your mind tomorrow?

76
00:06:23,744 --> 00:06:28,177
Then you can write down '"No thoughts
or emotions came up today, again. "

77
00:06:28,177 --> 00:06:31,449
You may say it’s the same every day.

78
00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:35,186
You don’t need to argue about it.

79
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:38,166
This couldn't be the problem
even if it’s same for 100 days,

80
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:40,183
it doesn’t matter if you don’t 
copy from yesterday one.

81
00:06:40,183 --> 00:06:48,165
If you didn’t have any thoughts or emotions arise,

82
00:06:48,165 --> 00:06:52,405
you can just write down “I didn’t have any defilements that came up during my practice.”

83
00:06:52,405 --> 00:06:55,365
If you didn’t have anything yesterday or today and won’t have anything tomorrow,

84
00:06:55,365 --> 00:06:59,107
it might make me say, “Oh, this person must have reached enlightenment”. Who knows? (laughter)

85
00:07:03,406 --> 00:07:09,247
My point is that you shouldn’t say you didn’t have any defilements

86
00:07:09,247 --> 00:07:13,528
because you were spaced out during practice.

87
00:07:13,528 --> 00:07:16,806
If you didn’t have any thoughts or emotions arising while you maintained your focus on practice, you can then say I didn’t have any defilements.

88
00:07:16,806 --> 00:07:23,436
That’s your impression, 
so you can write down in that way.

89
00:07:23,436 --> 00:07:27,079
If you have additional moments 
that you realized or repented about,

90
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:30,667
then you can write about 
those moments in your practice journal.

91
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:34,780
You don’t have to try hard 
intentionally to write down the journal.

92
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,786
If you can’t think of anything

93
00:07:36,786 --> 00:07:41,116
that means you are unable to
observe the current state of your mind.

94
00:07:41,116 --> 00:07:43,921
In other words, you are just blurred.

95
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:49,511
Or you might be Buddha. 
One of those two.

96
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:53,370
I hope the questioner is Buddha.
(Laughter)

97
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:57,570
Thank you.
