How Should I Write My Practice Journal?

2
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:27,431
Thank you so much for 
your wonderful Dharma talks.

3
00:00:27,431 --> 00:00:32,427
I start my day with practice 
first thing in the morning.

4
00:00:32,427 --> 00:00:37,774
It isn’t easy because it is very early,

5
00:00:37,774 --> 00:00:41,579
but what I find even more difficult 
is keeping a practice journal.

6
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:45,035
I do 108 prostrations 
with words for practice

7
00:00:45,035 --> 00:00:48,776
and then read the Jungto practice manual.

8
00:00:48,776 --> 00:00:54,139
But when I sit down 
to write a practice journal,

9
00:00:54,139 --> 00:00:57,654
I don’t know what to write

10
00:00:57,654 --> 00:01:03,478
because I feel pretty much 
the same way every day.

11
00:01:03,478 --> 00:01:10,415
Can you please advise me on 
how to write in my practice journal?

12
00:01:14,645 --> 00:01:24,630
I wonder if you are a little spacy 
when you practice,

13
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:31,848
a little out of focus.

14
00:01:31,848 --> 00:01:39,879
For example, let’s say your words for practice are

15
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:46,219
“My husband is Buddha” or 
“I will say yes and yield to my husband.”

16
00:01:46,219 --> 00:01:53,067
When you prostate yourself, 
you look back at yesterday and

17
00:01:53,067 --> 00:02:01,936
remember the moments when 
you didn’t yield to your husband

18
00:02:01,936 --> 00:02:05,981
and realize you missed your chance.

19
00:02:05,981 --> 00:02:10,457
'When my husband 
said something to me

20
00:02:10,457 --> 00:02:15,086
I shouted no at him 
instead of saying yes.

21
00:02:15,086 --> 00:02:18,975
I insisted that I was right.'

22
00:02:18,975 --> 00:02:21,966
“My husband is Buddha” means

23
00:02:21,966 --> 00:02:27,623
the same as I will say 
“yes” and yield to him.

24
00:02:27,623 --> 00:02:32,259
If your husband were actually Buddha, 
you would say yes to him, right?

25
00:02:32,259 --> 00:02:37,207
You wouldn’t say, 
“No, Buddha, that is not right!” Correct?

26
00:02:37,207 --> 00:02:39,889
If Buddha says something to you, 
you would say,

27
00:02:39,889 --> 00:02:43,514
“Oh, right, right. I will do as you say,” 
without any internal resistance.

28
00:02:43,514 --> 00:02:45,826
So “My husband is Buddha” means

29
00:02:45,826 --> 00:02:51,941
that you will accept whatever your husband 
says without any internal resistance.

30
00:02:51,941 --> 00:02:55,896
You accept the Buddha’s words 
unconditionally, don’t you?

31
00:02:55,896 --> 00:03:00,764
But just because you accept
every word from Buddha,

32
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:05,437
do you actually do everything 
he tells you to do? No.

33
00:03:05,437 --> 00:03:09,469
When you can’t carry out his teachings,

34
00:03:09,469 --> 00:03:14,040
what do you do? You repent.

35
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,388
In the same way, even if you accept

36
00:03:18,389 --> 00:03:23,015
whatever your husband tells you,

37
00:03:23,015 --> 00:03:26,846
it doesn’t mean you do 
what he wants every time.

38
00:03:26,846 --> 00:03:29,886
You probably can’t do more 
than what you think you can do.

39
00:03:29,886 --> 00:03:31,976
Then you might ask me 
why do I bother to say yes

40
00:03:31,976 --> 00:03:34,259
when I can’t even do what he wants me to do?
That’s not the point.

41
00:03:34,259 --> 00:03:36,978
You would say yes because your intention 
is to yield to him at that moment.

42
00:03:36,978 --> 00:03:42,779
But when you try to fulfill his wishes, 
you will find it very difficult.

43
00:03:42,779 --> 00:03:52,656
So, when you can’t, 
you will say you are sorry and repent.

44
00:03:52,656 --> 00:04:02,009
If you keep practicing 
like this every day,

45
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:06,676
someday you might still 
be tempted to shout “No”,

46
00:04:06,676 --> 00:04:12,835
but then you will remember
your words for practice

47
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:16,150
and say, 
“Yes, I will do it”, instead.

48
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:18,025
That's how it works.

49
00:04:18,025 --> 00:04:23,026
We don’t let a day pass by without repenting 
these moments of internal resistance.

50
00:04:23,026 --> 00:04:25,468
But what about the reality?

51
00:04:25,468 --> 00:04:29,599
Our pattern of saying no continues 
for 10 years, 20 years and even 30 years.

52
00:04:29,599 --> 00:04:33,720
We continue to blame others 
for creating problems for us.

53
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,046
This is why your heart feels so heavy.

54
00:04:40,026 --> 00:04:44,978
Even if you repent your past actions 
and vow not to repeat them again,

55
00:04:44,978 --> 00:04:54,891
you will momentarily forget 
your vow and, out of habit, say no.

56
00:04:54,891 --> 00:05:02,715
When this happens and your karma takes over, 
don’t be caught up 
in your thoughts for more than a day.

57
00:05:02,715 --> 00:05:08,027
When you practice in the morning, 
recognize those moments of being caught up and

58
00:05:08,027 --> 00:05:12,136
tell yourself, “I insisted on my way, 
so I missed my words for practice that time.”

59
00:05:12,136 --> 00:05:15,526
With such awareness writing 
your practice journal becomes simple and easy.

60
00:05:15,526 --> 00:05:20,276
You can write that when 
you conversed with 
your husband yesterday,

61
00:05:20,276 --> 00:05:25,987
you shouted no at him, 
but then realized during practice 
that you missed your vow at that moment.

62
00:05:25,987 --> 00:05:32,777
When you discovered 
you had missed your vow,

63
00:05:32,777 --> 00:05:35,817
you felt your heart became lighter.

64
00:05:35,817 --> 00:05:38,758
How can it be the same every day?

65
00:05:38,758 --> 00:05:40,996
I don't get it

66
00:05:40,996 --> 00:05:44,858
It can be the same only if your brain is 
always blurry every time you practice.

67
00:05:44,858 --> 00:05:47,347
If you can’t think of anything 
to write in your practice journal,

68
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:51,197
it means you were blurry yesterday, 
you are fuzzy today and you will be foggy tomorrow.

69
00:05:51,197 --> 00:05:54,066
That’s how it can be the same every day.

70
00:05:54,066 --> 00:05:58,790
Don’t force yourself to come up 
with something to write in your journal.

71
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:05,157
Thoughts arise naturally during bowing

72
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:08,907
if you focus on your words for practice.

73
00:06:08,907 --> 00:06:12,687
It could be just one thought, 
could be several thoughts.

74
00:06:12,687 --> 00:06:16,856
If you really had no thought,

75
00:06:16,856 --> 00:06:20,701
you can just write “I didn’t have any thoughts 
or emotions during my practice today.”

76
00:06:20,701 --> 00:06:23,744
What if nothing comes up 
in your mind tomorrow?

77
00:06:23,744 --> 00:06:28,177
Then you can write down I didn’t have 
any thoughts or emotions that came up 
today, either. (Laughter)

78
00:06:28,177 --> 00:06:31,449
You may say it’s the same every day.

79
00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:35,186
You don’t need to worry about it.

80
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:37,776
Even if it’s same for 100 days,

81
00:06:37,776 --> 00:06:41,853
it doesn’t matter as long as you don’t just 
copy and paste what you wrote yesterday.

82
00:06:41,853 --> 00:06:48,165
If you didn’t have any 
thoughts or emotions arise,

83
00:06:48,165 --> 00:06:52,405
you can just write down 
“I didn’t have any defilements 
that came up during my practice.”

84
00:06:52,405 --> 00:06:55,365
If you didn’t have anything yesterday or today 
and won’t have anything tomorrow,

85
00:06:55,365 --> 00:07:00,156
it might make me say, “Oh, this person must 
have reached enlightenment”. (Laughter)

86
00:07:00,156 --> 00:07:02,766
Who knows?

87
00:07:03,406 --> 00:07:09,247
My point is that you shouldn’t say 
you didn’t have any defilements 
because you were spaced out during practice.

88
00:07:09,247 --> 00:07:13,528
If you didn’t have any thoughts or emotions arising 
while you maintained your focus on practice

89
00:07:13,528 --> 00:07:16,806
, you can then say I didn’t have any defilements.

90
00:07:16,806 --> 00:07:23,436
That’s your impression, 
so you can write that down.

91
00:07:23,436 --> 00:07:27,079
If you have additional moments 
that you realized or repented about,

92
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:30,667
then you can write about 
those moments in your practice journal.

93
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:34,780
You don’t have to try hard intentionally 
to write something in your practice journal.

94
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,876
If you can’t think of anything 
to write down,

95
00:07:36,876 --> 00:07:41,116
that means you are unable to 
observe the current state of your mind.

96
00:07:41,116 --> 00:07:43,921
In other words, you are just blurred.

97
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:49,511
Or you might be Buddha. One of those two.

98
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:53,370
I hope you are the latter.
(Laughter)

99
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:57,570
Thank you.
