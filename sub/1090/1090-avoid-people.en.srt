1
00:00:03,627 --> 00:00:09,577
I avoid people I don't like. 
How can I change myself?

2
00:00:09,577 --> 00:00:11,917
(Questioner) Hello, 
I'm a freshman in college.

3
00:00:12,561 --> 00:00:17,201
When building relationships 
in high school,

4
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:20,590
I used to hang out with friends I like.

5
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:26,670
I wouldn't bother mingling with people
that I couldn't click with.

6
00:00:27,222 --> 00:00:30,892
I continued to do the same in college.

7
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:36,510
I'd hang out with only those I can connect
with, and not with those that I couldn't.

8
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:42,942
As I started meeting more people 
in college,

9
00:00:42,942 --> 00:00:46,950
I found more people
I couldn't get along with.

10
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:51,751
The more find them, the more I feel like
it has to do with my personality.

11
00:00:52,742 --> 00:00:57,842
The more I think 
I have an abnormal personality,

12
00:00:58,549 --> 00:01:07,289
the more I feel afraid to meet people. 
Should I change myself?

13
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,940
Your personality is not abnormal.

14
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:12,680
Your personality is what it is, 
but that doesn't make you abnormal.

15
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,819
You are who you are. 
When you were in high school,

16
00:01:16,819 --> 00:01:22,689
your relationships formed by
being placed in the same class for a year.

17
00:01:22,691 --> 00:01:27,281
Hence it was fine to hang out with 
only those whom you could connect with.

18
00:01:27,281 --> 00:01:33,179
Now that you're in college, you meet more 
people and develop broader relationships.

19
00:01:33,179 --> 00:01:36,043
In elementary school, 
you would've had 3 kids in your class

20
00:01:36,043 --> 00:01:37,623
that you couldn't get along with.

21
00:01:37,623 --> 00:01:42,903
Back then it was 3 out of 30 kids.
Now that you know 300 people,

22
00:01:42,903 --> 00:01:45,755
you have 30 people 
you don't get along with.

23
00:01:45,755 --> 00:01:52,505
So there is no real problem. 
It's just that you know more people now,

24
00:01:52,505 --> 00:01:56,150
hence you have more people 
you don't get along with.

25
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:59,920
Every living person in this world
has a different personality.

26
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,012
If you only want to form relationships 
with those you like,

27
00:02:03,012 --> 00:02:05,522
you can do so by limiting yourself
to a narrow scope.

28
00:02:05,522 --> 00:02:09,611
You can accept the limits 
without wanting more in your life.

29
00:02:09,611 --> 00:02:10,651
Do you understand?

30
00:02:10,651 --> 00:02:18,541
Assume you dislike a certain professor. 
You don't need to get along with him,

31
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:22,563
but instead you'll have to accept the fact
that you might not get the best grades.

32
00:02:22,563 --> 00:02:26,863
Assume you dislike your boss at work.

33
00:02:26,863 --> 00:02:29,344
You need to accept the fact that

34
00:02:29,344 --> 00:02:32,434
your relationship with him
may affect your promotion.

35
00:02:32,434 --> 00:02:36,934
The world does not only consist of people 
that you get along with.

36
00:02:36,934 --> 00:02:39,961
Such an attitude
does not affect you too much

37
00:02:39,961 --> 00:02:43,081
when you are young 
and protected by parents.

38
00:02:43,081 --> 00:02:45,501
Once you're over 20 and independent,

39
00:02:45,501 --> 00:02:47,921
your attitude may affect you negatively.

40
00:02:47,921 --> 00:02:51,601
Knowing this, 
should you change your ways or not?

41
00:02:51,601 --> 00:02:53,987
It's not that you should change 
as you are wrong.

42
00:02:53,987 --> 00:02:56,647
It's just that
it's inconvenient for you not to.

43
00:02:56,647 --> 00:03:04,107
In marriage, we change ourselves 
to adjust to a life as a pair.

44
00:03:04,107 --> 00:03:12,467
We change ourselves 
not because we are wrong.

45
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:15,707
Is it easy to change yourself?
(Questioner) It is not.

46
00:03:16,514 --> 00:03:17,965
(Sumin) Yes, it is not

47
00:03:18,215 --> 00:03:21,345
Personalities are a form of a habit.

48
00:03:21,345 --> 00:03:24,855
Habits are developed 
over a long period of time.

49
00:03:24,855 --> 00:03:27,616
For example, the inability to
express emotions is a habit.

50
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,616
It is karma.

51
00:03:28,616 --> 00:03:31,766
Such habits are very hard to change.

52
00:03:31,766 --> 00:03:35,608
They don't change even with
strong willpower.

53
00:03:35,608 --> 00:03:39,516
They don't change by attempting 
once or twice.

54
00:03:39,516 --> 00:03:45,127
Hence there is the saying
"Resolutions last three days".

55
00:03:45,127 --> 00:03:51,285
How to change? First, Just as habits are 
formed over a long period of time,

56
00:03:51,285 --> 00:03:55,275
changing habits also take 
a long period of time and practice.

57
00:03:55,275 --> 00:03:57,766
Try talking to people 
you don't get along with.

58
00:03:57,766 --> 00:04:00,396
You will feel resistance 
within yourself, will you not?

59
00:04:00,396 --> 00:04:02,547
Even so, continue trying.

60
00:04:02,547 --> 00:04:06,005
If you don't like snakes,

61
00:04:06,005 --> 00:04:10,995
spend an hour every morning
playing with snakes.

62
00:04:10,995 --> 00:04:12,115
(Audience Laughter)

63
00:04:12,115 --> 00:04:15,045
Touch them, kiss them and 
carry them around your neck.

64
00:04:15,045 --> 00:04:19,015
You'll be repulsed at first but 
will that doable as you continue or not?

65
00:04:19,015 --> 00:04:20,645
(Sunim) It's doable.

66
00:04:20,645 --> 00:04:27,283
If it works with snakes, 
why won't it work with people?

67
00:04:27,283 --> 00:04:28,776
It will work just fine.

68
00:04:28,784 --> 00:04:30,754
All you need is practice.

69
00:04:30,754 --> 00:04:36,874
Try practicing over a long period of time.

70
00:04:36,874 --> 00:04:40,513
Once you do, your former 
habits will change to new ones

71
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:43,763
Second, you should also try 
stimulating your unconscious mind.

72
00:04:43,763 --> 00:04:45,773
Habits are formed 
in the unconscious mind.

73
00:04:45,773 --> 00:04:49,463
They are not thoughts of the brain, 
they are reactions from the heart.

74
00:04:49,463 --> 00:04:54,251
Assume you've deeply acknowledged
a certain wrongdoing.

75
00:04:54,251 --> 00:04:56,361
You say "Ah, this was the problem!".

76
00:04:56,361 --> 00:04:59,762
Assume you've acknowledged it from
the heart and not from the mind.

77
00:04:59,762 --> 00:05:01,022
Tears start flowing.

78
00:05:01,022 --> 00:05:08,752
You're able to change yourself through 
practice in 100 days instead of 3 years.

79
00:05:08,752 --> 00:05:14,274
My dharma talks can be delivered
in theory by a college professor.

80
00:05:14,274 --> 00:05:18,884
But my talks touch you on an emotional level
rather than as logic, do they not?

81
00:05:18,884 --> 00:05:25,571
This is why you're able to find small changes
in your lives by listening to my talks.

82
00:05:25,571 --> 00:05:30,301
Small habits can change
by being emotionally touched.

83
00:05:30,301 --> 00:05:32,751
And yet habits formed in early childhood

84
00:05:32,751 --> 00:05:36,321
do not change regardless of 
such emotional stimulation.

85
00:05:36,321 --> 00:05:39,051
They are lodged in the
deep unconscious mind.

86
00:05:39,051 --> 00:05:44,884
It is unlikely that 
you can change such early habits.

87
00:05:44,885 --> 00:05:49,435
Hence we say
'God given personalities cannot be change'.

88
00:05:49,435 --> 00:05:51,445
Then is it impossible to change?

89
00:05:51,455 --> 00:05:53,385
No, it can be done.

90
00:05:53,385 --> 00:05:55,745
Then how can it be changed?

91
00:05:55,745 --> 00:06:01,836
Our survival instinct roots much deeper 
than our unconscious mind.

92
00:06:01,836 --> 00:06:04,776
When we feel that 
our survival is threatened,

93
00:06:04,776 --> 00:06:08,116
we become capable of changing habits.

94
00:06:08,116 --> 00:06:10,766
The fact that Jesus fasted for 40 days

95
00:06:10,766 --> 00:06:13,846
indicates there had been a threat 
to his survival instinct.

96
00:06:13,846 --> 00:06:16,746
The fact that Buddha practiced 
severe suffering for 6 years

97
00:06:16,756 --> 00:06:19,236
indicates it threatens 
to his survival instinct.

98
00:06:19,236 --> 00:06:24,127
In such way people were able to 
change their karmic habits

99
00:06:24,127 --> 00:06:26,177
which most find impossible to change.

100
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:30,947
You can also exert a threat
to your survival instinct

101
00:06:30,947 --> 00:06:36,777
if you haven't been interacting with
those that you dislike.

102
00:06:36,777 --> 00:06:40,707
How? You can give yourself 
an electric shock.

103
00:06:40,707 --> 00:06:42,087
(Audience Laughter)

104
00:06:42,087 --> 00:06:48,237
If you have a hard time getting up in the
morning even with an alarm clock,

105
00:06:48,237 --> 00:06:54,467
ask your mom to give you an electric shock
a few times every morning.

106
00:06:54,467 --> 00:06:58,697
Will you then be able to hear 
the alarm at 5 am or not?

107
00:06:58,697 --> 00:07:02,294
Be honest, 
will be hear the alarm or not?

108
00:07:02,294 --> 00:07:05,424
No matter how sound asleep you are, 
you will hear the alarm.

109
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:09,232
The moment you hear it, 
your body will immediately react to it.

110
00:07:09,232 --> 00:07:11,052
You'll wake up instantly.

111
00:07:11,052 --> 00:07:16,152
So no need to put effort into it. 
Threatening your survival will do.

112
00:07:16,152 --> 00:07:22,518
Young men join the army and change
their worst habits, do they not?

113
00:07:22,518 --> 00:07:29,589
They do. In the army, 
you are required to follow strict rules

114
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:33,739
and regulations without an excuse.

115
00:07:33,739 --> 00:07:36,580
You join the army with a conviction
and understand that

116
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,270
excuses aren't tolerated.

117
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:43,310
Try saying 'I'm kind of sick'.
It can't be used as an excuse.

118
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:49,051
Hence during military service,
you're able to overcome your habits.

119
00:07:50,044 --> 00:07:57,694
Now I don't think you will go through 
with the electric shock method.

120
00:07:57,694 --> 00:08:01,643
So once you decide to change yourself,

121
00:08:01,643 --> 00:08:05,613
deliberately choose to meet only those 
you don't like.

122
00:08:05,613 --> 00:08:08,883
In class, converse with the person
you most dislike.

123
00:08:08,883 --> 00:08:11,834
Say "How have you been?"
If they say they hate you,

124
00:08:11,834 --> 00:08:14,264
say "I like your facial 
expression of hatred."

125
00:08:14,264 --> 00:08:19,184
Have lunch with the person you dislike.

126
00:08:19,184 --> 00:08:23,827
Think of it as playing with a snake. 
This should be better off than that.

127
00:08:24,187 --> 00:08:25,905
Do you understand?

128
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:29,155
As you practice persistently, 
you'll be able to change yourself.

129
00:08:29,155 --> 00:08:34,065
Will you change yourself 
in order to live a broader life?

130
00:08:34,065 --> 00:08:36,978
Are you willing to do undesirable things

131
00:08:36,978 --> 00:08:40,728
knowing they are ultimately
in your interest?

132
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:45,598
Or would you rather just live according to 
your karmic habits regardless of interest?

133
00:08:45,598 --> 00:08:47,148
Would you rather live a life dealing with
only those you like?

134
00:08:47,148 --> 00:08:49,188
The latter option works too.

135
00:08:49,188 --> 00:08:52,148
But you'll have to give up on
certain interests. Understand?

136
00:08:52,148 --> 00:08:53,837
(Questioner) Yes.

137
00:08:53,837 --> 00:08:56,407
(Applause)
