00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:06,797
I'm told my child is ill due to a bad name. 
What should I do?

2
00:00:07,847 --> 00:00:15,068
(Questioner) Hello, I'm the only man 
who ask about their own child

3
00:00:15,558 --> 00:00:21,626
I'm a father of two children. 
My second child has been severely ill.

4
00:00:21,626 --> 00:00:26,068
He was hospitalized the day he was born,

5
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:31,567
and has continued treatment after being discharged.

6
00:00:31,567 --> 00:00:36,908
I have a family member that goes to a temple a lot.

7
00:00:38,188 --> 00:00:47,757
The temple monk heard of my son 
and said that my child has a bad name.

8
00:00:47,757 --> 00:00:53,127
He said that the name will continue 
his illness for the rest of his life.

9
00:00:53,257 --> 00:00:58,698
The monk hence created 
a new name for him.

10
00:00:59,168 --> 00:01:06,398
I've always been capable of 
making decisions throughout life.

11
00:01:06,398 --> 00:01:12,208
But since this matter involves 
my child's issues, I'm lost as to what to do.

12
00:01:12,248 --> 00:01:19,948
His current name was properly 
created by a traditional name maker.

13
00:01:20,778 --> 00:01:24,722
And yet the monk claims 
the name is very bad.

14
00:01:24,722 --> 00:01:30,000
He came up with a new name and 
recommends we change our child's name.

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,187
Since you are here, I'd like to 
seek your thoughts on this.

16
00:01:34,187 --> 00:01:38,732
Just change it. What's there to ask? 
If he says it will be good then change it.

17
00:01:38,732 --> 00:01:41,737
But you shouldn't think a name 
change will cure your child's illness.

18
00:01:41,737 --> 00:01:45,593
If you do, you'll resent the monk for it. You'll 
feel like the name change has done no good.

19
00:01:46,713 --> 00:01:52,172
Do you really think changing a name
would influence your child's health?

20
00:01:52,422 --> 00:01:54,808
Use your common sense.

21
00:01:54,808 --> 00:01:59,382
But if you feel like changing names 
would be something you'd do

22
00:01:59,382 --> 00:02:02,888
out of slight hope under difficult 
circumstances, try it out.

23
00:02:02,888 --> 00:02:06,349
Many of us have two names 
while we grow up, do we not?

24
00:02:06,549 --> 00:02:12,120
People used to name their
daughters using certain letters

25
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,677
hoping it would make them their 
last daughter (and have a son)

26
00:02:17,087 --> 00:02:21,476
Try using a new name in the same manner.

27
00:02:21,476 --> 00:02:26,912
When you become a Buddhist, 
you get a new Buddhist name, do you not?

28
00:02:26,932 --> 00:02:29,188
You can try a new name the same way.

29
00:02:29,188 --> 00:02:30,835
(Sunim) Regardless of whether 
the name will help you or not,

30
00:02:30,835 --> 00:02:34,151
(Sunim) you value the monk's opinion.

31
00:02:34,151 --> 00:02:36,819
And the monk said so, 
so you might as well follow.

32
00:02:36,819 --> 00:02:39,861
You ask me my thoughts even after 
the monk gave you a name.

33
00:02:39,861 --> 00:02:42,592
You'll probably ask some other monk 
his opinion of my opinion.

34
00:02:42,592 --> 00:02:44,988
One gives you a name, 
another may say the name's not good.

35
00:02:44,988 --> 00:02:46,290
Then you'd ask another how he thinks.

36
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:51,687
Are you trying to start a fight 
among us all? What for?

37
00:02:51,687 --> 00:02:54,323
Why the hassle? If he says 
it's a good name, just call him that.

38
00:02:54,323 --> 00:02:56,417
Why ask around? What for?

39
00:02:57,507 --> 00:03:04,967
My wife and I've been hesitant to change 
the name for the last two months.

40
00:03:04,967 --> 00:03:07,246
What does your wife think?

41
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:10,777
(Questioner) She leaves it all up to me.

42
00:03:10,847 --> 00:03:13,726
Which way do you think 
she's leaning towards?

43
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:15,789
(Questioner) I'm not exactly sure.

44
00:03:15,789 --> 00:03:21,242
She says the current name is fine. 
Then she says the new name seems ok too.

45
00:03:21,452 --> 00:03:25,459
If changing a name changes your fortune, 
everyone would change their name.

46
00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:28,537
Why work hard?

47
00:03:28,537 --> 00:03:31,479
Why would a monk shave 
his head and practice?

48
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:34,997
All they need to do is change their name 
and they'd reach enlightenment.

49
00:03:36,337 --> 00:03:40,817
Try the new name without 
expecting too much of it.

50
00:03:41,407 --> 00:03:45,988
I understand where you're coming 
from as a parent of an ill child.

51
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:52,064
But such weak thoughts 
raise these problems.

52
00:03:52,064 --> 00:03:54,279
My thoughts are simple.

53
00:03:54,279 --> 00:03:57,150
If he says the name's good, 
try using it in your daily life.

54
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,408
You already have a name 
registered, do you not?

55
00:03:59,408 --> 00:04:02,318
leave the registered name as is 
and try using the new name.

56
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:05,508
If good things happen, then you 
can officially change it later on.

57
00:04:05,508 --> 00:04:07,410
Why change it now? Just try calling it.

58
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:10,827
I will try that. Thank you.

59
00:04:13,237 --> 00:04:15,408
Think of parenting this way.

60
00:04:15,408 --> 00:04:22,438
Let's say your child is tall, 
handsome and does well in school.

61
00:04:22,438 --> 00:04:26,840
If he's tall, handsome and smart, 
would the parents only like him?

62
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,522
Or would all the neighbors like him?

63
00:04:29,522 --> 00:04:31,969
All the neighbors would like him.

64
00:04:31,969 --> 00:04:34,417
Hence it wouldn't be a
parent's mindset to like him

65
00:04:34,417 --> 00:04:39,518
A parent should love a child even if he's 
short, ugly, stupid and has a bad temper.

66
00:04:39,518 --> 00:04:44,376
Even if the whole world hates him, 
a parent should love him.

67
00:04:44,376 --> 00:04:48,165
That is what a parent is.

68
00:04:48,165 --> 00:04:51,506
If not, you're nothing more than 
a neighbor. You're not a parent.

69
00:04:51,506 --> 00:04:57,319
In the same manner, it would be 
nice to have a healthy child.

70
00:04:57,319 --> 00:05:04,317
And yet the child was born 
with a disability or a serious illness.

71
00:05:04,317 --> 00:05:09,729
Obsessing over making the child 
healthy only makes the child suffer.

72
00:05:09,729 --> 00:05:14,088
The whole family also suffers 
because of the child. Do you understand?

73
00:05:14,088 --> 00:05:17,175
So when you have a child with disability,

74
00:05:17,175 --> 00:05:22,190
think to yourself, 'He could have been 
abandoned if he were born elsewhere'

75
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:30,300
'But I'm a Buddhist/Christian, hence will 
think of it as my calling and care for him

76
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:35,680
A parent takes care of a child whether
he/she is with a disability,

77
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,368
a girl or a boy, smart or not. 
A parent doesn't discriminate.

78
00:05:41,368 --> 00:05:46,369
That is a mind of a parent.
That is also the mind of a Buddha.

79
00:05:46,421 --> 00:05:51,880
If you are too held up on the issue, 
it only brings anxieties to your household.

80
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:58,586
Happily accept the disability 
and shortcoming as is,

81
00:05:58,586 --> 00:06:02,454
and care for the child in the condition 
he is in until his time is done.

82
00:06:02,454 --> 00:06:06,109
If you approach it with such an attitude, 
you won't be as frustrated.

83
00:06:06,109 --> 00:06:08,837
As you try clutching at a straw

84
00:06:08,837 --> 00:06:13,037
then you are experiencing 
such difficulties.

85
00:06:13,037 --> 00:06:16,860
Do you understand?

86
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:20,707
Listening to you speak, you're 
not in the mindset of a parent.

87
00:06:20,707 --> 00:06:24,297
You are in the mindset of a neighbor.

88
00:06:24,297 --> 00:06:26,675
A parent shouldn't love 
their child for getting better,

89
00:06:26,675 --> 00:06:29,615
and love less for not getting better.

90
00:06:29,615 --> 00:06:34,004
A parent should always 
encourage their child.

91
00:06:34,004 --> 00:06:36,576
When he asks of things, 
you should say

92
00:06:36,576 --> 00:06:42,426
"What do I know? 
You know better than me, son."
