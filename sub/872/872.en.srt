00:00:03,295 --> 00:00:06,411
I Want to Get Married. 
How Should I Approach Marriage?

2
00:00:07,706 --> 00:00:13,003
I am over 30 years old now.
Since I am single and over 30 years old.

3
00:00:13,363 --> 00:00:20,132
my parents and relatives talk a lot of 
marriage at family gatherings.

4
00:00:20,422 --> 00:00:25,646
However, I will be going abroad to study
in few months

5
00:00:25,846 --> 00:00:31,370
I figured 
I wasn't ready to get married yet.

6
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:34,890
But there has been a connection 
made because of you.

7
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:36,960
I met someone.

8
00:00:37,024 --> 00:00:42,374
And she gave me one of your books,
"Words of Wisdom for Newlyweds" as a gift.

9
00:00:42,534 --> 00:00:45,926
I read the passage that said,
"Greed leads to marriage, and

10
00:00:45,966 --> 00:00:50,865
when you think you don't want to get 
married, that's when you can get married"

11
00:00:51,005 --> 00:00:53,945
Then, I saw her and 
I fell in love with her all of sudden.

12
00:00:53,945 --> 00:00:55,195
(Audience Laughter)

13
00:00:55,245 --> 00:00:56,969
You took the bait.

14
00:00:57,019 --> 00:00:58,754
(Audience Laughter)

15
00:00:58,934 --> 00:01:04,107
So, I talked to her and she said 
that she read all of your books

16
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:07,824
and she told me 
that she can also live like a Sunim.

17
00:01:07,894 --> 00:01:12,095
At that moment, I instantly felt 
that she was the one for me

18
00:01:12,095 --> 00:01:14,237
and give her everything I got

19
00:01:14,307 --> 00:01:18,227
even though we haven't known 
each other that long.

20
00:01:18,227 --> 00:01:21,036
Sunim, would it be okay to marry her?

21
00:01:21,076 --> 00:01:24,906
(Audience Laughter)

22
00:01:24,926 --> 00:01:28,287
(Sunim) You both want to get married?

23
00:01:28,287 --> 00:01:30,415
(Sunim) Then just get married. 
Why do you ask me?

24
00:01:30,455 --> 00:01:31,835
(Audience) (Laughter/Applause)

25
00:01:31,835 --> 00:01:33,435
Thank you.

26
00:01:33,445 --> 00:01:36,895
I thought you would tell me 
to go ahead and marry her,

27
00:01:36,945 --> 00:01:40,505
but I wanted to actually hear it from you.

28
00:01:40,575 --> 00:01:44,465
I live alone, so why would I tell you 
to get married? Don't get married.

29
00:01:44,465 --> 00:01:47,654
(Audience Laughter)

30
00:01:47,704 --> 00:01:49,254
(Questioner) Thank you.

31
00:01:49,492 --> 00:01:53,945
You came to gloat, didn't you?
You came to show off!

32
00:01:53,945 --> 00:02:01,074
You are gloating. My goodness.
You are quite happy. So happy.

33
00:02:03,024 --> 00:02:07,013
Sure, you are happy now. 
Go ahead and live together.

34
00:02:07,023 --> 00:02:11,017
(Audience) Laughter/Applause

35
00:02:11,057 --> 00:02:13,867
Do you know 
why the audiences are clapping?

36
00:02:13,887 --> 00:02:15,624
You think they are congratulating you,
don't you?

37
00:02:15,654 --> 00:02:17,710
That's a big miskake.

38
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,240
(Audience Laughter)

39
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:21,208
They are applauding 
because they are thinking,

40
00:02:21,238 --> 00:02:24,198
"Just wait and live with each other 
for a year"

41
00:02:24,258 --> 00:02:30,369
"You will know what it feels like".

42
00:02:30,409 --> 00:02:35,900
So, don't expect marriage 
to be something special.

43
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:41,138
You each have different personalities,
thoughts and beliefs, etc. right?

44
00:02:41,158 --> 00:02:44,648
You should never try to change
the other person to be like you.

45
00:02:44,678 --> 00:02:51,559
Don't try to restrict each other, 
and accept each other as you are.

46
00:02:51,559 --> 00:02:54,880
With this king of mindset,
you can live happily with anyone.

47
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,038
If you insist your own ways on each other,

48
00:02:58,088 --> 00:03:03,478
you can't be happy 
even with your soulmate.

49
00:03:03,608 --> 00:03:08,691
Once you are married, 
you should live happily ever after, right?

50
00:03:10,111 --> 00:03:12,081
Good luck!

51
00:03:12,081 --> 00:03:13,731
