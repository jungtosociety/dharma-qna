1
00:00:03,246 --> 00:00:08,439
My wife attends Catholic Church.

2
00:00:08,459 --> 00:00:11,867
We both attended 
Catholic Church in the past.

3
00:00:11,867 --> 00:00:16,562
But at some point 
I realized it wasn't for me

4
00:00:16,562 --> 00:00:20,527
and stopped attending many years ago.

5
00:00:20,527 --> 00:00:26,068
I remained non-religious for a while 
but became interested in Buddhism.

6
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:33,368
Although they aren't 
official Buddhist scriptures,

7
00:00:33,368 --> 00:00:39,096
I've been finding comfort in reading books
by Zen priests at times of difficulty.

8
00:00:39,096 --> 00:00:47,786
I've felt more at peace and am now 
strongly drawn towards Buddhist faith.

9
00:00:47,786 --> 00:00:53,798
When I go to the mountains, 
I stop at a temple to offer 108 bows.

10
00:00:53,798 --> 00:00:58,008
I recently even completed 3,000 bows.

11
00:00:58,008 --> 00:01:02,586
Lately my wife found out about this.

12
00:01:02,586 --> 00:01:10,738
Since then, she stubbornly 
refuses to talk to me.

13
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:15,667
She claims that it would be 
difficult to maintain a marriage

14
00:01:15,667 --> 00:01:20,497
with a person of Buddhist faith.

15
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:29,078
I've tried convincing her that 
religious beliefs should be respected.

16
00:01:29,078 --> 00:01:37,577
But as Christians tend to be exclusive, 
she won't accept my point of view.

17
00:01:37,577 --> 00:01:45,957
Ironically my wife had no religion 
when we got married.

18
00:01:45,957 --> 00:01:53,248
I initially persuaded her 
to go to church with me.

19
00:01:53,248 --> 00:01:57,348
And now that I go to Buddhist temples 
instead of church,

20
00:01:57,348 --> 00:02:00,768
she seems to feel betrayed.

21
00:02:00,768 --> 00:02:07,238
As Christians tend to be exclusive,

22
00:02:07,238 --> 00:02:13,007
my wife is stubbornly 
refusing to talk about it.

23
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:21,787
My wife doesn't expect me 
to return to Catholic church.

24
00:02:21,787 --> 00:02:25,409
She requests that

25
00:02:25,409 --> 00:02:29,887
I at least remain free of religion 
for the sake of our family.

26
00:02:29,887 --> 00:02:37,503
I told her that Buddhism 
is the essence of who I am,

27
00:02:37,503 --> 00:02:45,286
hence renouncing my values 
would mean losing myself.

28
00:02:45,286 --> 00:02:49,538
No matter what I say, 
she won't understand.

29
00:02:49,538 --> 00:02:53,517
So it's really difficult.

30
00:02:53,517 --> 00:02:56,646
Are you subservient to her?

31
00:02:56,646 --> 00:02:57,716
(Audience Laughter)

32
00:02:57,716 --> 00:03:02,367
Religious differences aside, are you 
generally subservient to your wife?

33
00:03:02,367 --> 00:03:03,977
(Questioner) It's not like that.

34
00:03:03,977 --> 00:03:08,382
(Sunim) I'm just asking. 
Are you subservient to her or not?

35
00:03:08,382 --> 00:03:10,817
(Questioner) I'm not.

36
00:03:10,817 --> 00:03:12,975
If not, you don't have an issue.

37
00:03:12,975 --> 00:03:16,497
If you are subservient, 
it would be a problem.

38
00:03:16,497 --> 00:03:21,547
But if you are not, 
your problem isn't difficult to resolve.

39
00:03:21,547 --> 00:03:24,798
In other words, if you are 
in an equal relationship with her,

40
00:03:24,798 --> 00:03:27,868
or better yet in a slightly 
dominant position,

41
00:03:27,868 --> 00:03:33,277
you can make up to her through 
other things aside from religion.

42
00:03:33,277 --> 00:03:45,378
I've been married to her for 25 years, 
so I know her personality well.

43
00:03:45,378 --> 00:03:49,858
She's very headstrong and stubborn 
once she makes up her mind.

44
00:03:49,858 --> 00:03:55,121
She doesn't have a gentle, 
understanding personality.

45
00:03:55,121 --> 00:03:57,827
You chose to marry her. 
What can you do about that?

46
00:03:57,827 --> 00:04:02,305
(Questioner)
That's why I'm here.

47
00:04:02,305 --> 00:04:08,255
I can't seem to find a solution myself 
no matter how hard I try.

48
00:04:08,255 --> 00:04:11,187
Is your wife passionate 
and actively involved

49
00:04:11,187 --> 00:04:14,167
in church activities on a daily basis?

50
00:04:14,167 --> 00:04:28,180
She isn't completely obsessed with church,
but she's quite serious about it.

51
00:04:29,388 --> 00:04:38,177
Given you weren't raised a Buddhist 
and had once attended church,

52
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:41,066
it may seem to her that you're obsessed 
with Buddhism. Can this be the case?

53
00:04:41,066 --> 00:04:44,918
I don't think so.

54
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:50,807
She has seen me reading 
Buddhism related books though.

55
00:04:50,807 --> 00:04:54,605
Then you should explain to her 
that unlike Christianity,

56
00:04:54,605 --> 00:05:00,815
Buddhism is a philosophy 
and a study of the mind.

57
00:05:00,815 --> 00:05:03,565
Try recommending her things 
to read for fun.

58
00:05:03,565 --> 00:05:04,927
(Questioner)
That won't work.

59
00:05:04,927 --> 00:05:07,747
She fundamentally rejects 
Buddhism altogether.

60
00:05:07,747 --> 00:05:10,367
Even if she resists, you can say

61
00:05:10,367 --> 00:05:13,047
"I'm not changing my religion.

62
00:05:13,047 --> 00:05:16,737
I'm studying Buddhism 
out of academic interest."

63
00:05:16,737 --> 00:05:20,447
Instead of saying 
"I want to be a Buddhist",

64
00:05:20,447 --> 00:05:26,805
you can say "I went hiking and passed by 
a nice and serene temple, so I bowed."

65
00:05:26,805 --> 00:05:29,916
You might be acting too obvious.

66
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:32,168
I haven't been too obvious.

67
00:05:32,168 --> 00:05:41,367
It's just that given 
I do believe in Buddhism,

68
00:05:41,367 --> 00:05:44,696
I can't lie about it.

69
00:05:44,696 --> 00:05:55,888
I told her I won't be upfront about 
my beliefs, but she still refuses.

70
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:58,885
So I'm at a loss.

71
00:05:58,885 --> 00:06:02,514
Is she asking for a divorce 
because of this?

72
00:06:02,514 --> 00:06:06,768
She's not, but she insists that I should 
at least return to having no faith

73
00:06:06,768 --> 00:06:10,608
in order to maintain 
a normal relationship.

74
00:06:10,608 --> 00:06:12,706
What does she mean 
by a normal relationship?

75
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,357
Is she refusing to sleep with you?

76
00:06:14,357 --> 00:06:16,127
(Sunim)
Is she using that as a weapon?

77
00:06:16,127 --> 00:06:19,937
No, it's not that. We're not even 
conversing at the moment.

78
00:06:19,937 --> 00:06:21,590
So now...

79
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,767
If you can't talk to her, 
think of it this way.

80
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:27,826
Don't be too anxious to talk to her.

81
00:06:27,826 --> 00:06:30,796
Leave her alone 
if she doesn't want to talk to you.

82
00:06:30,796 --> 00:06:33,307
Don't get frustrated over it.

83
00:06:33,307 --> 00:06:36,065
Why get frustrated over 
this as a person who's practicing?

84
00:06:36,065 --> 00:06:40,656
Even if she's not talking to you, 
treat her with ease and comfort.

85
00:06:40,656 --> 00:06:43,377
If she asks anything, always respond.

86
00:06:43,377 --> 00:06:46,026
If she doesn't want to be bothered,

87
00:06:46,026 --> 00:06:48,976
leave her alone and 
focus on cultivating yourself

88
00:06:48,976 --> 00:06:55,128
Silent meditation is an important practice
Hence you can practice silent meditation.

89
00:06:55,128 --> 00:07:00,977
It seems like you're not understanding 
the situation from a Buddhist perspective.

90
00:07:00,977 --> 00:07:04,457
Once you do, there is no problem.

91
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:13,878
Just say "Yes, honey, you are right. 
I'm sorry". Don't be too obvious.

92
00:07:13,878 --> 00:07:18,358
I am not obvious about my faith 
when I'm home.

93
00:07:18,358 --> 00:07:27,338
But I think I must have shared my address 
with a Buddhist organization once.

94
00:07:27,338 --> 00:07:31,738
A letter was sent home.

95
00:07:31,738 --> 00:07:33,997
One day I got home from work 
and my wife says,

96
00:07:33,997 --> 00:07:42,827
"I received this letter, 
and I tossed it out."

97
00:07:42,827 --> 00:07:47,226
I'm not saying you should lie.

98
00:07:47,226 --> 00:07:52,825
You can say, "Ah, I must have left 
our address on a guestbook

99
00:07:52,825 --> 00:07:58,335
at a temple while hiking."

100
00:07:58,335 --> 00:08:01,226
I understand.
So should I give it more time?

101
00:08:01,226 --> 00:08:02,901
It's not about giving it more time.

102
00:08:02,901 --> 00:08:09,431
You should be at peace yourself 
in order to understand your wife.

103
00:08:09,431 --> 00:08:17,147
You should think to yourself, 
'She must have felt disappointed that

104
00:08:17,147 --> 00:08:22,347
I insisted we go to church, 
and now I go to temples instead.'

105
00:08:22,347 --> 00:08:31,689
'My wife tends to commit to things, so 
of course my actions would've upset her.'

106
00:08:31,689 --> 00:08:34,048
Try to empathize with her.

107
00:08:34,048 --> 00:08:36,016
When she complains, tell her

108
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:41,157
"I understand how you feel. 
Don't worry too much though.

109
00:08:41,157 --> 00:08:46,797
I'm just growing old and getting curious.

110
00:08:46,797 --> 00:08:51,477
I want to study different things and am 
finding myself interested in these books."

111
00:08:51,477 --> 00:08:54,547
"It's not a matter of religion 
like you think it is.

112
00:08:54,547 --> 00:08:57,477
Zen masters don't ever say 
believe in a god."

113
00:08:57,477 --> 00:08:59,528
"They never ask to believe in Buddhism.

114
00:08:59,528 --> 00:09:03,178
I'm just studying it for the sake 
for studying, so no need to worry."

115
00:09:03,178 --> 00:09:06,538
Make an effort 
to improve your relationship.

116
00:09:06,538 --> 00:09:10,365
Do the dishes for her 
if you haven't been.

117
00:09:10,365 --> 00:09:15,527
If you change for the better 
while going to temples,

118
00:09:15,527 --> 00:09:18,287
she won't consider religious differences
as a problem.

119
00:09:18,287 --> 00:09:22,266
If you don't change for the better, 
then it becomes a problem.

120
00:09:22,266 --> 00:09:27,306
Hence I asked earlier on who the dominant 
person is in your relationship.

121
00:09:27,306 --> 00:09:38,017
If you're the dominant person, you should 
give up your rights and be nicer to her.

122
00:09:38,017 --> 00:09:43,621
If you're the subservient person, 
being nicer may seem servile.

123
00:09:43,621 --> 00:09:45,096
(Audience Laughter)

124
00:09:45,096 --> 00:09:49,132
Your spouse may look down on you 
even more, hence I asked.

125
00:09:49,132 --> 00:09:54,374
If you are on equal footing,

126
00:09:54,374 --> 00:10:01,559
you can accommodate to your wife 
areas beside religion.

127
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:05,538
Empathize with her more 
when she speaks, be accepting.

128
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:11,286
If you do that, your wife will notice 
the positive changes in you.

129
00:10:11,286 --> 00:10:15,887
If she ever mentions, "Hmm, I think 
you're acting different these days",

130
00:10:15,887 --> 00:10:18,478
you can say, 
"Really? I don't know.

131
00:10:18,478 --> 00:10:23,968
I've been reading books on 
Buddhism and Zen masters."

132
00:10:23,968 --> 00:10:27,698
"I realize that all my life 
I've been living single-minded."

133
00:10:27,698 --> 00:10:34,516
"Life is short, I shouldn't have been 
insisting on things too much.

134
00:10:34,516 --> 00:10:37,586
I've been reflecting on myself, 
maybe that's changed me."

135
00:10:37,586 --> 00:10:40,483
You should continue talking 
to her this way.

136
00:10:40,483 --> 00:10:44,976
If your wife argues with you 
over going to temple today,

137
00:10:44,976 --> 00:10:47,496
say you are sorry.

138
00:10:47,496 --> 00:10:50,167
If she's surprised 
by your unexpected response,

139
00:10:50,167 --> 00:10:52,677
say "The monk told me 
that marriage is most important,

140
00:10:52,677 --> 00:10:56,187
hence I shouldn't be obsessing over 
religion too much."

141
00:10:56,187 --> 00:11:01,296
"He told me 
to put religion behind marriage"


142
00:11:01,296 --> 00:11:03,406
This will show her that I'm on her side.

143
00:11:03,406 --> 00:11:06,975
Hence she may think to herself that 
the monk isn't all that bad after all.

144
00:11:06,975 --> 00:11:09,085
(Audience Laughter)

145
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:16,405
Empathize with her this way 
and slowly start talking to her.

146
00:11:16,405 --> 00:11:20,167
There is no need to say she should 
believe in Buddhism because you do.

147
00:11:20,167 --> 00:11:25,030
If your attitude in life becomes 
more composed,

148
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:32,537
understanding and tolerant,

149
00:11:32,537 --> 00:11:37,126
your wife will naturally become 
accepting of your ways.

150
00:11:37,126 --> 00:11:41,708
You'll face conflict at first 
as she won't get things her way.

151
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:46,698
But no matter how hard 
she resists and complains,

152
00:11:46,698 --> 00:11:50,657
smile and say, 
"I understand. Yes, I will do as you say."

153
00:11:50,657 --> 00:11:53,786
"Don't worry too much, 
I'm just studying that's all."

154
00:11:53,786 --> 00:11:59,299
As time goes by, 
she will come around and accept things.

155
00:11:59,299 --> 00:12:04,805
She may even become curious 
and ask about things.

156
00:12:04,805 --> 00:12:06,336
So take a long term perspective.

157
00:12:06,336 --> 00:12:09,087
Don't try to find a quick fix for it.

158
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:11,627
(Questioner)
Yes, I will do that.

159
00:12:11,627 --> 00:12:15,496
(Applause)
