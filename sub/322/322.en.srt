1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,955
Not Easy to Concede

2
00:00:22,305 --> 00:00:25,759
Sunim, 
Thank you for your wonderful teaching.

3
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:32,704
You have told us whoever wants to gain 
more should compromise or concede.

4
00:00:32,809 --> 00:00:35,110
But when I am faced with such situation,

5
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:39,955
it's hard to dismiss the angry feeling and
the feeling that I should react somehow.

6
00:00:39,985 --> 00:00:41,608
By way of example,

7
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:48,448
my brother had much conflict 
with our mother after getting married,

8
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:51,658
and due to a conflict between his wife 
and our mother,

9
00:00:51,658 --> 00:00:55,807
my brother took a portion of 
our mother's asset.

10
00:00:55,807 --> 00:00:58,532
I accepted his action thinking,

11
00:00:58,532 --> 00:01:05,272
"He must have had a reason to do it; 
he can spend it,"

12
00:01:05,272 --> 00:01:07,754
But I am having difficulties 
with thinking that

13
00:01:07,754 --> 00:01:17,766
my brother could get greedy
and he and I could get into dispute.

14
00:01:18,065 --> 00:01:22,106
Our poor relations with North Korea 
and its nuclear weapon problem.

15
00:01:22,106 --> 00:01:26,301
Must we give into the demands of others,

16
00:01:26,301 --> 00:01:31,271
knowing that they are not behaving 
correctly or fairly?

17
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:32,829
Or wouldn't it be better

18
00:01:32,829 --> 00:01:35,979
to confront directly 
and engage in the fight and confrontation?

19
00:01:35,979 --> 00:01:38,226
Wouldn’t this be better?

20
00:01:38,226 --> 00:01:41,159
Unless, one is a dedicated Buddhist monk,

21
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,338
isn't there a limitation to our ability 
to always compromise and/or concede?

22
00:01:46,998 --> 00:01:48,688
(Audience Laughter)

23
00:01:52,738 --> 00:02:01,738
The mind of this questioner is 
everyone's common mind.

24
00:02:01,808 --> 00:02:07,508
However, giving away everything 
when asked is Buddha's mind.

25
00:02:09,018 --> 00:02:11,436
Giving everything that is asked of.

26
00:02:11,446 --> 00:02:18,430
However, it is our reality 
that we cannot live like Buddha.

27
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,311
So we can choose from here on

28
00:02:23,311 --> 00:02:29,625
to manifest Buddha's mind 
and act with such whenever possible.

29
00:02:29,645 --> 00:02:34,958
Even if we are not yet at that level,

30
00:02:34,968 --> 00:02:41,168
we ought to try and raise our level a bit 
by adopting Buddha's mind.

31
00:02:41,178 --> 00:02:43,912
But let us examine our own minds.

32
00:02:43,912 --> 00:02:46,753
When you see your brother 
taking the inheritance,

33
00:02:46,753 --> 00:02:49,635
you just remain in an upset state

34
00:02:49,635 --> 00:02:54,240
without the ability 
to either fight or bring it back.

35
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:59,880
You lose the inheritance 
and you are also suffering.

36
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:06,600
But, if you at least, 
want to have a peace of mind,

37
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,817
you can tell him "OK, you take it,"

38
00:03:08,817 --> 00:03:13,657
then at least you won't feel bad 
even if you lose the money.

39
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:17,957
Then you won't lose both, 
rather just the money.

40
00:03:19,057 --> 00:03:24,427
Wouldn't that be wiser?'
is the question I raise.

41
00:03:24,444 --> 00:03:28,924
If you are determined to get your share of
the assets, then you should fight.

42
00:03:31,194 --> 00:03:35,924
Then you may get the assets 
but it would be complicated to fight,

43
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:38,454
wouldn't it?

44
00:03:39,444 --> 00:03:43,355
You cannot complain 
that you are suffering then.

45
00:03:43,395 --> 00:03:47,664
If you do not want to suffer, 
you can simply let go of the money.

46
00:03:47,664 --> 00:03:52,894
So, if you want the assets, then fight.

47
00:03:52,894 --> 00:03:59,004
But when you fight with anger, 
you are the one who will suffer.

48
00:03:59,004 --> 00:04:03,144
But if you accept that your brother, too, 
want this money as you do,

49
00:04:03,144 --> 00:04:06,812
then you will not be as angry.

50
00:04:06,812 --> 00:04:12,531
Not being angry here means, 
you will not be suffering.

51
00:04:12,531 --> 00:04:14,675
In that state of mind,

52
00:04:14,675 --> 00:04:22,525
if you choose to obtain your share
of the inheritance guaranteed by law,

53
00:04:22,525 --> 00:04:29,213
instead of fighting, 
you can talk it out or go to court.

54
00:04:29,213 --> 00:04:38,336
You get stressed with damaged relationship
with your brother,

55
00:04:38,336 --> 00:04:40,346
but you will gain some money.

56
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:42,325
Then, you have to choose:

57
00:04:42,325 --> 00:04:46,713
to gain money or 
good relationship with your brother.

58
00:04:46,713 --> 00:04:52,263
You just have to choose 
to gain one and lose the other.

59
00:04:52,263 --> 00:04:56,423
In general, most of us lose both of them.

60
00:04:56,423 --> 00:05:01,267
A wise person would take one 
and lose the other.

61
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:10,137
Bodhisattvas would actually gain both
by letting go of both.

62
00:05:10,137 --> 00:05:11,208
So, people say,

63
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:17,068
"Doesn't that mean we lose everything 
if we follow Buddha's teaching?"

64
00:05:17,068 --> 00:05:24,482
There is no gain or loss 
in Buddha's teaching.

65
00:05:24,482 --> 00:05:27,122
Drop the idea of gain.

66
00:05:27,122 --> 00:05:30,942
It belongs to your parents anyway, 
it wasn't yours.

67
00:05:30,942 --> 00:05:34,336
So your brother's desire 
to have the assets

68
00:05:34,336 --> 00:05:38,151
and your desires 
to have them too are the same.

69
00:05:38,151 --> 00:05:40,355
You must recognize 
that both of you are same.

70
00:05:40,355 --> 00:05:43,772
You think it is unfair for him to take 
but is fair for you to take.

71
00:05:43,772 --> 00:05:50,332
You suffer 
because you think your brother is greedy.

72
00:05:52,092 --> 00:05:55,623
As a younger brother, 
you think things should be divided evenly,

73
00:05:55,623 --> 00:06:00,240
while your brother thinks 
that he deserves more.

74
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:06,160
Because he wants more, the younger brother
thinks his brother is being greedy.

75
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:11,558
The older brother thinks 
in the old fashioned way.

76
00:06:11,558 --> 00:06:13,827
The older brother should deserve more.

77
00:06:13,827 --> 00:06:16,558
You ask the younger brother 
is thinking in a modern way.

78
00:06:16,558 --> 00:06:19,209
You follow the recently changed law.

79
00:06:19,209 --> 00:06:25,306
Your brother follows the old law.

80
00:06:25,306 --> 00:06:28,746
Women, these days, want to divide 
things evenly following the new law.

81
00:06:28,746 --> 00:06:31,555
While the men want 
to retain the old fashioned way.

82
00:06:31,555 --> 00:06:33,160
(Audience Laughter)

83
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,790
That is why if you ask each person,

84
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:43,757
they have reasons to justify their points.

85
00:06:43,897 --> 00:06:46,759
Even the things that seem unjust to me,

86
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:53,515
another person can find the justification 
and will be able to rationalize it.

87
00:06:53,515 --> 00:06:56,516
That's why people act this way.

88
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:59,877
From my point of view, I get upset.

89
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:03,667
But from other's point of view, 
we can come to understand.

90
00:07:03,709 --> 00:07:07,149
When we say, " I understand,"
there are two ways to interpret this:

91
00:07:07,149 --> 00:07:11,579
I understand but do not agree.

92
00:07:11,579 --> 00:07:15,969
I understand and agree as well.

93
00:07:16,859 --> 00:07:19,416
There are reasons for 
the North Korean government

94
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:21,836
to develop and launch nuclear missiles.

95
00:07:21,836 --> 00:07:25,187
It is understandable.

96
00:07:25,187 --> 00:07:30,602
It is understandable, but is it desirable?

97
00:07:30,652 --> 00:07:33,982
You would think it is not desirable.

98
00:07:33,982 --> 00:07:38,937
You often suffer 
because you refuse to understand.

99
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:43,524
But I can understand as a monk.

100
00:07:43,524 --> 00:07:47,647
Some other people even agree with it

101
00:07:47,647 --> 00:07:52,077
I, myself, do not agree with it. 
I am critical of the situation.

102
00:07:52,077 --> 00:07:56,767
Possession of a nuclear weapon 
is a loss for you and us.

103
00:07:56,787 --> 00:08:00,186
It is a foolish move.

104
00:08:00,306 --> 00:08:06,673
But I can understand 
the people behaving in foolish ways.

105
00:08:06,673 --> 00:08:11,224
The arguments between a couple, 
for example

106
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:13,504
I understand

107
00:08:13,854 --> 00:08:16,700
But is that a good way to behave?

108
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:22,910
I certainly do not think so.

109
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:26,363
But since I can understand,

110
00:08:26,363 --> 00:08:28,073
I continue to accept requests 
for advice on such matters.

111
00:08:28,073 --> 00:08:30,050
I think, "that would be possible."

112
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,450
But because I think it is not desirable,
I often suggest

113
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:38,947
"Don't do it that way 
and try doing it this way"

114
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:44,280
I wouldn't be able to counsel 
if I didn't understand.

115
00:08:47,767 --> 00:08:49,747
That's is where the difference lies.

116
00:08:49,747 --> 00:08:55,196
Understanding does not mean 
that you condone what the other is doing.

117
00:08:55,196 --> 00:08:58,297
You come to understand
the other person's point of view.

118
00:08:58,297 --> 00:09:02,187
You can understand the other's situation 
from his point of view.

119
00:09:02,267 --> 00:09:05,470
If you understand, 
then you can begin to communicate.

120
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:11,925
If you don't understand, 
then you don't feel like talking.

121
00:09:11,965 --> 00:09:15,853
That is why, first, try to understand.

122
00:09:15,913 --> 00:09:17,760
At the very least, try to understand…

123
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,338
Who will benefit from this understanding? 
You will.

124
00:09:20,368 --> 00:09:24,175
You will not experience the tightening 
of your heart and you will not be angry.

125
00:09:24,175 --> 00:09:27,886
So, choose one between these two attitudes

126
00:09:27,886 --> 00:09:29,740
At least, have one thing under control

127
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:33,050
and decide 
to fight over the money or not.

128
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:36,105
If you want both, 
then fight and see what happens.

129
00:09:36,105 --> 00:09:39,850
If you are ok with only one of these 
two positions, you can give up the other.

130
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:42,284
Doesn't this seem to be a wise choice?

131
00:09:42,284 --> 00:09:43,285
Does it seem foolish?

132
00:09:43,285 --> 00:09:47,375
(Audience Laughter)

133
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:54,115
It would be good to behave wisely, 
especially for the sly ones…

134
00:09:54,135 --> 00:10:00,237
Would it be easier to assert the fairness 
about the inheritance with wise manner?

135
00:10:00,237 --> 00:10:05,767
Or would it be easier to assert one's
position with an angry and enraged state?

136
00:10:05,877 --> 00:10:08,638
It would be easier 
to choose the first one, right?

137
00:10:08,638 --> 00:10:11,958
It would be easier to convince 
your brother through communication

138
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:17,868
but also convince the judge.

139
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:22,918
“I understand why you come to act 
this way, dear brother."

140
00:10:22,918 --> 00:10:29,058
“But I, too want to receive at least the 
amount that is legally due to me, etc."

141
00:10:29,088 --> 00:10:33,138
If you speak in this manner, the judge 
will think your points are justified.

142
00:10:33,138 --> 00:10:34,921
By way of an example.

143
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:42,353
That is why it is better to act wisely.
