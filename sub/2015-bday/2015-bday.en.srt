1
00:00:00,173 --> 00:00:11,682
Buddha was born in this world 
2639 years ago.

2
00:00:11,682 --> 00:00:22,523
Scriptures portray his birth 
in a very mystical manner.

3
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:27,733
We don't know whether these descriptions 
were based on truth

4
00:00:27,733 --> 00:00:31,204
or fictionalized in later dates.

5
00:00:31,204 --> 00:00:37,314
From a religious perspective, it can be 
said that his birth was extraordinary.

6
00:00:37,314 --> 00:00:41,471
because he was 
an extraordinary person

7
00:00:41,471 --> 00:00:47,314
From a historical perspective, 
it can be said that

8
00:00:47,314 --> 00:00:51,238
these descriptions were written

9
00:00:51,238 --> 00:01:00,525
after the fact 
to glorify Buddha's greatness.

10
00:01:00,525 --> 00:01:14,725
They say that Buddha's mother 
had a dream about his birth.

11
00:01:14,735 --> 00:01:18,176
In her dream, music filled the skies.

12
00:01:18,176 --> 00:01:22,219
and when she stepped outside, 
she saw a bright star approaching her.

13
00:01:22,219 --> 00:01:28,255
Then she noticed that the shining star 
was actually a white elephant.

14
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:32,596
In India, a white elephant 
is considered a good omen.

15
00:01:32,596 --> 00:01:38,624
While ordinary elephants have 2 ivory 
tusks, white elephants are said to have 6.

16
00:01:38,624 --> 00:01:42,702
Hence they are 
considered most sacred in India.

17
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:48,749
In her dream, this 6-tusked 
white elephant descended from the sky.

18
00:01:48,749 --> 00:01:54,497
It struck her on the right side of 
her ribs and entered into her.

19
00:01:54,497 --> 00:02:06,438
She was startled and woke from the dream 
and afterwards she conceived a baby.

20
00:02:06,438 --> 00:02:14,679
In those days in India, women 
gave birth in their parents' house.

21
00:02:14,679 --> 00:02:18,589
So Buddha's mother headed home 
when she was 9 months pregnant.

22
00:02:18,589 --> 00:02:23,289
Buddha's father was 
the king Suddhodana.

23
00:02:23,289 --> 00:02:28,169
He was from the Sakya clan, while 
Buddha's mother was from the Koliya clan.

24
00:02:28,169 --> 00:02:31,999
They were from two different clans

25
00:02:31,999 --> 00:02:35,239
but there was a marital alliance 
between the two.

26
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:41,099
Hence females from this clan would wed 
males from the other clan, and vice versa.

27
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:49,451
The country was about the size of Kaya.

28
00:02:49,451 --> 00:02:57,381
It was basically more of a tribal state, 
rather than a developed kingdom.

29
00:02:57,381 --> 00:03:03,569
It was a small country that 
Buddha was born a crown prince.

30
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:07,042
His mother was 
heading home to give birth.

31
00:03:07,042 --> 00:03:11,542
The sun was shining hard midday,

32
00:03:11,542 --> 00:03:18,682
so she came across a forest 
and decided to take a rest.

33
00:03:18,682 --> 00:03:23,982
That place is known as Lumbini.

34
00:03:23,982 --> 00:03:34,241
She was resting in the hills of Lumbini, 
where there was a grove of Ashoka trees.

35
00:03:34,241 --> 00:03:38,493
The ashoka trees were 
full of blossoms.

36
00:03:38,493 --> 00:03:44,247
While enjoying them, 
she found a beautiful blossom

37
00:03:44,247 --> 00:03:53,950
and reached up with her right hand. 
As she did, she felt labor pain.

38
00:03:53,950 --> 00:04:02,076
A tent was set up quickly
and she gave birth to a baby.

39
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:16,074
The baby came out through 
her right ribs, and not the usual way.

40
00:04:16,077 --> 00:04:28,755
The gods of Heaven and Brahman came down 
and caught the baby in a golden net.

41
00:04:28,755 --> 00:04:35,356
And as the Dragon king came 
and bathed the baby with water,

42
00:04:35,356 --> 00:04:39,457
the baby’s body 
shined with a golden glow.

43
00:04:39,457 --> 00:04:42,785
This is how baby Buddha 
was described in the scriptures.

44
00:04:42,785 --> 00:04:47,447
Now they say the infant 
stood right up

45
00:04:47,447 --> 00:04:54,037
and walked seven steps 
across all four directions.

46
00:04:54,037 --> 00:04:57,067
After that, he stood pointing 
one hand towards the sky

47
00:04:57,067 --> 00:04:59,377
and the other towards the earth

48
00:04:59,377 --> 00:05:05,087
and shouted "In the Heavens above and 
Earth beneath, I alone am the Honored One.

49
00:05:05,087 --> 00:05:08,007
All that exists 
in the Three Worlds is suffering

50
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:10,647
but I will bring comfort to all."

51
00:05:10,647 --> 00:05:18,507
Of course, he would have said this 
in Indian language, not in Chinese.

52
00:05:18,507 --> 00:05:23,868
He would've said it in Indian 
but the scriptures we refer to

53
00:05:23,868 --> 00:05:28,675
translate them in Chinese this way.

54
00:05:28,675 --> 00:05:32,489
So that's the story of his birth.

55
00:05:32,489 --> 00:05:40,939
When it says the baby shined 
in a golden glow after a bath means

56
00:05:40,939 --> 00:05:49,509
the baby was born human with human form, 
but was indeed a Buddha.

57
00:05:49,509 --> 00:05:57,471
Can this be real? Did he really 
come out of his mother's right side?

58
00:05:57,471 --> 00:06:03,630
Could she have had 
a cesarean back then?

59
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:06,740
This story raises some questions.

60
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:12,960
Did he really walk seven steps? 
And did an infant really talk?

61
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,960
The story raises many questions.

62
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:23,951
Some can believe the story without 
any doubt, 'He's a sacred being after all.

63
00:06:23,951 --> 00:06:27,631
Of course he was born differently',

64
00:06:27,631 --> 00:06:31,401
this is called faith.

65
00:06:31,401 --> 00:06:34,600
Is it wrong to have such faith? 
Or is it okay?

66
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,701
It's okay to believe this. Why? 
We have freedom to have faith.

67
00:06:38,701 --> 00:06:46,820
So if some of us believe his birth story, 
then it is out of the religious faith.

68
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:51,941
If some say "Unbelievable. 
It can't be true.",

69
00:06:51,941 --> 00:06:55,933
then does it imply 
the lack of faith? No, it doesn't.

70
00:06:55,933 --> 00:07:01,512
We have freedom 
to believe or not to believe.

71
00:07:01,512 --> 00:07:05,582
Those with faith 
just believe the story.

72
00:07:05,582 --> 00:07:10,592
For those who don't believe the story, 
how would they take the story?

73
00:07:10,592 --> 00:07:15,523
They can take them 
as symbolic narratives.

74
00:07:15,523 --> 00:07:21,153
During Buddha's time, 
Indian people believed

75
00:07:21,153 --> 00:07:28,793
social phenomena 
in terms of the gods.

76
00:07:28,793 --> 00:07:33,603
They believed that all things 
have divine presence in them.

77
00:07:33,603 --> 00:07:41,689
That's why the birth 
was described like that.

78
00:07:41,689 --> 00:07:47,484
So what does that mean? To be born 
from his mother's right torso, this,

79
00:07:47,484 --> 00:07:52,282
symbolizes that he is 
from a royal background.

80
00:07:52,282 --> 00:08:01,454
Because, in traditional Brahman beliefs, 
the Brahmin god created this world,

81
00:08:01,454 --> 00:08:05,605
and humans were his last creations.

82
00:08:05,605 --> 00:08:11,375
Out of the god's mouth came 
the Brahmin, class of priests.

83
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:22,818
Out of his torso, Kshatriya, 
or the rulers and military elites emerged.

84
00:08:22,818 --> 00:08:28,475
From his stomach, he created Vaishya, 
the class of farmers and merchants.

85
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:34,506
And from his feet came the Shudra, 
the class of slaves.

86
00:08:34,506 --> 00:08:42,302
This is the origin of 
India's four caste system.

87
00:08:42,302 --> 00:08:47,136
The castes were basically 
justified as god's creation.

88
00:08:47,136 --> 00:08:49,437
Because of such myth, 
the idea that

89
00:08:49,437 --> 00:08:54,507
Buddha was born through 
his mother's ribs means

90
00:08:54,507 --> 00:09:03,722
he belonged to the royal class, 
the Kshatriya.

91
00:09:03,722 --> 00:09:10,818
Then what does it symbolize that 
he walked seven steps on his own?

92
00:09:10,818 --> 00:09:17,090
Traditional Indian culture has 
a unique concept of reincarnation.

93
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:26,019
In this concept, there are more realms 
between heaven and hell.

94
00:09:26,019 --> 00:09:30,081
There are 6 realms in total.

95
00:09:30,081 --> 00:09:37,520
They are Hell, the realm of 
hungry ghosts, the realm of beasts,

96
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:43,630
the realm of fighting spirits,

97
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:50,310
the realm of human beings 
and the land of heavenly beings.

98
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:55,001
One moves from one to another 
in these six realms,

99
00:09:55,001 --> 00:09:59,111
hence we call it 
the 'Six realms of Samsara'.

100
00:09:59,111 --> 00:10:02,300
As you see it's quite different 
from western religions.

101
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:06,449
In the west once you go to Hell, 
you stay there forever.

102
00:10:06,449 --> 00:10:12,021
Once in Heaven, you're forever in Heaven. 
This isn't all that rational, is it?

103
00:10:12,021 --> 00:10:15,500
In such aspect, 
Indian beliefs are more rational.

104
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:22,762
If you do good and go to heaven, you can 
stay there until your good karma runs out.

105
00:10:22,762 --> 00:10:28,092
If you do evil and go to hell, you stay 
there until your punishment ends.

106
00:10:28,092 --> 00:10:32,505
So we are all trapped 
in this cycle through the 6 realms.

107
00:10:32,505 --> 00:10:35,505
It's called the "wheel of life."

108
00:10:35,505 --> 00:10:40,202
We cannot escape 
this wheel of life.

109
00:10:40,202 --> 00:10:48,813
Hence even if we go to Heaven, 
it is not eternal.

110
00:10:48,813 --> 00:10:53,973
The six steps Buddha took 
refer to the six realms.

111
00:10:53,973 --> 00:11:00,264
The fact that he took a seventh step 
means that he stepped out of this cycle.

112
00:11:00,264 --> 00:11:02,704
He had achieved Enlightenment 
and reached Nirvana.

113
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:06,645
Through this, he was truly freed 
from the cycle of life.

114
00:11:06,645 --> 00:11:14,252
Nirvana refers to the state of 
true happiness, free from all suffering.

115
00:11:14,252 --> 00:11:20,344
Hence the story of his birth 
was written to show that

116
00:11:20,344 --> 00:11:25,935
Buddha was meant to achieve 
Enlightenment and reach Nirvana.

117
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:31,264
We know he eventually 
achieved Enlightenment,

118
00:11:31,264 --> 00:11:34,185
hence stories are written to say 
he was born to do so.

119
00:11:34,185 --> 00:11:43,025
I'm a monk now, hence they'd say 
I was destined to become a monk.

120
00:11:43,025 --> 00:11:45,611
Fortune tellers say 
'You'll die if you go somewhere',

121
00:11:45,611 --> 00:11:48,021
hence we don't go there 
and we don't die.

122
00:11:48,021 --> 00:11:52,648
if we know the future in advance, 
things become meaningless.

123
00:11:52,648 --> 00:11:56,046
Nothing is predetermined.

124
00:11:56,046 --> 00:12:02,587
So it's more logical to say that 
Buddha's birth story was written later,

125
00:12:02,587 --> 00:12:10,697
telling us that he was 
born to become a Buddha.

126
00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:15,007
So if I were to live my ordinary life

127
00:12:15,007 --> 00:12:18,855
and do something extraordinary 
before dying,

128
00:12:18,855 --> 00:12:31,058
they'll probably say that 
I too was born to do great things.

129
00:12:31,058 --> 00:12:36,038
So the seven steps symbolize 
stepping beyond the cycle of life

130
00:12:36,038 --> 00:12:40,668
and becoming an Enlightened one.

131
00:12:40,668 --> 00:12:44,148
Pointing toward the sky 
and the earth, he shouted,

132
00:12:44,148 --> 00:12:48,988
"In the Heavens above and Earth beneath, 
I alone am the honored one.”

133
00:12:48,988 --> 00:12:51,248
This is only the first part 
of what he said.

134
00:12:51,248 --> 00:12:55,108
Most people remember only this. 
But you need to know the next clause.

135
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:57,578
"All that exists 
in the Three Worlds is suffering,

136
00:12:57,578 --> 00:13:00,258
but I will bring comfort to all."

137
00:13:00,258 --> 00:13:08,219
People interpret the first clause 
in a secular manner,

138
00:13:08,219 --> 00:13:13,019
and think he was very egotistic 
to say such things.

139
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:19,980
When he refers to the 'In the Heavens 
above and Earth beneath',

140
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:37,880
he's actually referring to both 
the land of Gods and land of Humans.

141
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:57,133
Saying he alone is the Honored One means 
that he is the most precious among all.

142
00:13:57,133 --> 00:14:05,892
He's referring to himself when saying 
"I alone am the Honored One',

143
00:14:05,892 --> 00:14:09,733
but this ultimately applies to us all.

144
00:14:09,733 --> 00:14:12,523
Why? Because we are all 
capable of becoming Buddha.

145
00:14:12,523 --> 00:14:17,303
We all have it in ourselves 
to become enlightened.

146
00:14:17,303 --> 00:14:24,574
Hence he's basically declaring dignity 
of all human beings.

147
00:14:24,574 --> 00:14:34,794
Yet, do you consider yourself 
the most precious being?

148
00:14:34,794 --> 00:14:43,643
Buddha proclaimed that 
across all heaven and earth,

149
00:14:43,643 --> 00:14:49,134
he himself is 
the most precious of them all.

150
00:14:49,134 --> 00:15:04,065
In western world, they say human rights 
are God-given, don't they?

151
00:15:04,075 --> 00:15:14,596
When they say it's 'God-given', 
they are putting God above Human.

152
00:15:14,596 --> 00:15:17,996
Buddha's story is based on 
a completely different approach.

153
00:15:17,996 --> 00:15:26,995
Why? He's saying that 
he himself is the most precious,

154
00:15:26,995 --> 00:15:39,597
not just among Human 
but also among land of Gods.

155
00:15:39,598 --> 00:15:44,586
Now what is he referring to 
as 'Earth beneath'?

156
00:15:44,586 --> 00:15:47,917
He's referring to secular things.

157
00:15:47,917 --> 00:15:52,198
First of all, money. 
Are you more precious than money or not?

158
00:15:52,198 --> 00:15:54,238
(Audience) We're more precious 
than money.

159
00:15:54,238 --> 00:15:59,398
Well, you say you are.
(Audience Laugh)

160
00:15:59,398 --> 00:16:05,541
And yet if a company offers 
to pay you $20,000 more,

161
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:10,768
do you jump at the opportunity or not?

162
00:16:10,768 --> 00:16:16,278
Are you then not selling 
yourself for money?

163
00:16:16,278 --> 00:16:28,690
When getting married, 
do you not marry a guy who earns more?

164
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:33,790
You all go for the money.

165
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:38,399
Even when a person dies, 
what do we do?

166
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,120
Don’t insurance companies 
put a price on death?

167
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:50,820
They pay more for plane crashes victims 
and pay less for bus accidents victims.

168
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:58,110
In a way we're living in a world that 
puts money first, not human beings.

169
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:04,031
In this world, 
money is the most precious.

170
00:17:04,031 --> 00:17:13,711
In the medieval period, 
God came first.

171
00:17:13,711 --> 00:17:24,451
Now, we live in a capitalist society, 
where money comes above all of us.

172
00:17:24,453 --> 00:17:35,494
But Buddha is saying the most precious 
of all is not money, power, or fame.

173
00:17:35,494 --> 00:17:45,204
It's not desire, pleasure, 
ideology, faith, or god.

174
00:17:45,204 --> 00:17:49,783
What is most precious? 
I, myself is the most precious.

175
00:17:49,783 --> 00:17:53,842
Do you live with 
that level of self-awareness?

176
00:17:53,842 --> 00:17:56,362
Do you consider yourselves precious?

177
00:17:56,362 --> 00:18:01,434
Do you think you are 
more precious than diamonds?

178
00:18:01,434 --> 00:18:04,432
Not just yourself, but others as well?

179
00:18:04,432 --> 00:18:08,183
Buddha's saying that all living beings 
are the most precious,

180
00:18:08,183 --> 00:18:12,179
every single one of them.

181
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:18,128
No belief is more precious 
than life itself.

182
00:18:18,128 --> 00:18:26,946
No ideology or belief can come above us.

183
00:18:26,946 --> 00:18:29,294
This preciousness is not given 
by another entity.

184
00:18:29,294 --> 00:18:31,284
It is absolutely intrinsic to all beings.

185
00:18:31,284 --> 00:18:34,015
Human beings come first

186
00:18:34,015 --> 00:18:42,345
and only then comes ideology, 
belief, moral, money, power, etc.

187
00:18:42,345 --> 00:18:45,305
But in reality, 
things don't work this way.

188
00:18:45,305 --> 00:18:53,984
We've lost sight of 
our own preciousness.

189
00:18:53,984 --> 00:19:02,485
We've lost ourselves and put money,

190
00:19:02,485 --> 00:19:11,475
ideologies, beliefs, status 
and power above us.

191
00:19:11,475 --> 00:19:18,125
In such, modern society 
is called as an era of self-loss.

192
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:25,715
As we’ve lost ourselves, we're no longer 
in charge of the house. Without an owner,

193
00:19:25,715 --> 00:19:28,999
the house is taken over by thieves.

194
00:19:28,999 --> 00:19:33,995
This is why our lives are in misery.

195
00:19:33,995 --> 00:19:40,286
We take life so lightly 
that we can kill ourselves.

196
00:19:40,286 --> 00:19:45,316
We also can kill other people 
so easily with guns and all.

197
00:19:45,316 --> 00:19:47,848
Do you know how many 
suicides occur daily?

198
00:19:47,848 --> 00:19:52,918
On average, 43 people 
commit suicide daily in Korea.

199
00:19:52,918 --> 00:20:02,178
That is like a bus full of 
people all dying from a crash.

200
00:20:02,178 --> 00:20:08,027
This is all due to self-loss.

201
00:20:08,027 --> 00:20:12,239
Buddha came to this world

202
00:20:12,239 --> 00:20:18,219
to declare the dignity and 
preciousness of all human lives.

203
00:20:18,219 --> 00:20:26,008
He did so because these were not 
recognized back then.

204
00:20:26,008 --> 00:20:29,814
There is an anecdote about Buddha:

205
00:20:29,814 --> 00:20:40,899
One day, while he was meditating, a group 
of 30 young men came by and asked him.

206
00:20:40,899 --> 00:20:44,216
"Have you seen a women 
running away just now?"

207
00:20:44,216 --> 00:20:47,740
"Why do you ask?" 
Buddha said.

208
00:20:47,740 --> 00:21:00,283
The young men had gone 
on a picnic with their girlfriends.

209
00:21:00,283 --> 00:21:09,413
After drinking and dancing, 
they got drunk and passed out.

210
00:21:09,413 --> 00:21:19,753
They woke up only to realize that 
all their valuables had been stolen.

211
00:21:19,766 --> 00:21:28,794
It turned out that one of 
the men didn't have a girlfriend,

212
00:21:28,794 --> 00:21:40,671
so he had paid a prostitute 
to come to the picnic with him.

213
00:21:40,671 --> 00:21:49,635
When everyone got drunk 
and passed out,

214
00:21:49,635 --> 00:21:54,969
that prostitute stole everyone's 
valuables and ran away.

215
00:21:54,969 --> 00:22:01,455
So they were asking Buddha 
if he saw a woman running away.

216
00:22:01,455 --> 00:22:04,985
Buddha looked at them, 
smiled, and said,

217
00:22:04,985 --> 00:22:10,906
"My friends, is it more important 
to find your belongings,

218
00:22:10,906 --> 00:22:17,366
or to find yourself?"

219
00:22:17,366 --> 00:22:22,826
Although drunk, the men replied,

220
00:22:22,826 --> 00:22:29,476
"Of course, it's more important 
to find ourselves."

221
00:22:29,476 --> 00:22:33,717
Then, Buddha told them 
to come and sit with him.

222
00:22:33,717 --> 00:22:35,260
What does this imply?

223
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:40,090
He was pointing out how they were fussing 
over losing their belongings,

224
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:43,647
while they had actually lost themselves.

225
00:22:43,647 --> 00:22:53,987
Buddha had them sit down 
and spoke to them.

226
00:22:53,987 --> 00:23:00,538
And the 30 men all came to realization

227
00:23:00,538 --> 00:23:06,688
and they became monks 
right then and there.

228
00:23:06,688 --> 00:23:09,609
The scriptures say that 
the youth back in those days

229
00:23:09,609 --> 00:23:11,519
were quite the pleasure seekers.

230
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:17,739
When he was young, Buddha himself 
enjoyed pleasurable things.

231
00:23:17,739 --> 00:23:23,229
The story of the monk Yasa 
also portrays this.

232
00:23:23,229 --> 00:23:30,910
Yasa and his friends were drinking and 
dancing at night and they fell asleep.

233
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:33,407
When Yasa woke up,

234
00:23:33,407 --> 00:23:41,997
he saw in the candlelight 
all his friends passed out.

235
00:23:41,997 --> 00:23:46,700
The female dancers who looked

236
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:52,820
so beautiful the night before 
were all sleeping too.

237
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:56,879
Some of them were snoring, 
others had vomited next to them,

238
00:23:56,879 --> 00:24:00,951
some were exposing their breasts,

239
00:24:00,951 --> 00:24:04,361
others had their legs 
on top of each other.

240
00:24:04,361 --> 00:24:09,081
Back then in India, corpses of 
the lowest class would get thrown out

241
00:24:09,081 --> 00:24:13,702
in the woods without being cremated.

242
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:18,182
As they'd get thrown out, corpses would 
all tangle on top of one another.

243
00:24:18,182 --> 00:24:27,482
Yasa found his friends and 
the beautiful dancers in the same way.

244
00:24:27,482 --> 00:24:36,864
He thought, "Ah, what agony. How did 
my ballroom become a graveyard?"

245
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:43,803
He eventually met Buddha 
and became a monk.

246
00:24:43,803 --> 00:24:45,622
In today's terms,

247
00:24:45,622 --> 00:24:50,212
he was like the sole heir of 
a conglomerate like Samsung.

248
00:24:50,212 --> 00:24:55,395
The monk Yasa was 
son of Guriga Jangja.

249
00:24:55,395 --> 00:25:00,363
The scriptures contain 
many stories like this.

250
00:25:00,363 --> 00:25:07,241
They show us that youth back then 
were pleasure seekers to a great extent.

251
00:25:07,241 --> 00:25:13,654
Yasa had friends not only in his country 
but also in other countries.

252
00:25:13,654 --> 00:25:21,684
Seeing how a man like Yasa, who enjoyed 
such luxurious life, could become a monk,

253
00:25:21,684 --> 00:25:25,494
four of his friends assumed that surely 
he must have been deceived and misled.

254
00:25:25,494 --> 00:25:30,075
"Yasa would never become a monk;

255
00:25:30,075 --> 00:25:33,075
he loves to party with us," 
the friends said.

256
00:25:33,075 --> 00:25:36,193
When they went to rescue Yasa, 
his friends met Buddha.

257
00:25:36,193 --> 00:25:39,533
And they all became monks.
(Audience Laugh)

258
00:25:39,533 --> 00:25:44,574
"This wizard must have some power. 
Let's all go and rescue him",

259
00:25:44,574 --> 00:25:51,204
said Yasa's 50 friends 
from other countries.

260
00:25:51,204 --> 00:25:55,334
They all went to rescue Yasa. They met 
Buddha, and all became monks.

261
00:25:55,334 --> 00:26:01,845
This is the famous story of 
Yasa and his 54 friends.

262
00:26:01,845 --> 00:26:09,526
Yasa and his 54 friedns,

263
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:13,951
as well as the 5 initial disciples, 
became the 60 first disciples of Buddha.

264
00:26:13,951 --> 00:26:17,907
Through them, Buddha declared 
his willingness to spread his teachings.

265
00:26:17,907 --> 00:26:26,147
I mention these stories to say that 
people in Buddha's time were influenced

266
00:26:26,147 --> 00:26:34,908
by materialism, power, desire, 
money, and pleasure.

267
00:26:34,908 --> 00:26:40,578
On the other hand, 
there were religious folks

268
00:26:40,578 --> 00:26:43,578
that were blindly faithful 
to Brahman beliefs.

269
00:26:43,578 --> 00:26:45,528
Regardless of the sin,

270
00:26:45,528 --> 00:26:52,188
they'd believe they'd go to Heaven 
as long as they bathe in the Ganges.

271
00:26:52,188 --> 00:26:58,757
This is why Buddha mentioned both 
'In the Heavens above and Earth beneath'.

272
00:26:58,757 --> 00:27:04,529
There's another anecdote of Buddha.

273
00:27:04,529 --> 00:27:13,709
One day, King Bimbisara asked himself 
while studying Buddha's teachings.

274
00:27:13,709 --> 00:27:18,379
'What is the most precious thing 
in this world?'

275
00:27:18,379 --> 00:27:26,880
He was a king and he had 
a big house, precious jewels, swords,

276
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:33,370
carriages, horses, beautiful women, etc.

277
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:37,979
He wondered what could be 
the most precious of them all.

278
00:27:37,979 --> 00:27:44,717
If he had to choose just one, 
everything felt too precious.

279
00:27:44,717 --> 00:27:48,451
But they all felt like 
nothing in a way too.

280
00:27:48,451 --> 00:27:56,301
So he asked his wife Malike:

281
00:27:56,301 --> 00:28:04,900
"What do you think is 
the most precious in the world?"

282
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:20,291
Now, the right answer for a wife 
to tell her husband would be,

283
00:28:20,291 --> 00:28:24,503
"It is you and you alone."

284
00:28:24,503 --> 00:28:30,411
Back in those days, 
Kings ruled with absolute power.

285
00:28:30,411 --> 00:28:32,903
And yet Malike responded,

286
00:28:32,903 --> 00:28:38,023
"I've thought long and hard, I think 
I myself am the most precious."

287
00:28:38,023 --> 00:28:41,023
She could've been killed 
for responding this way.

288
00:28:41,023 --> 00:28:43,513
And yet the king said,

289
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:50,524
"Do you think so too? I agree, 
I think I'm the most precious too."

290
00:28:50,524 --> 00:28:57,824
So they went to Buddha with their story.

291
00:28:57,824 --> 00:29:05,243
"We both thought about it long and hard.

292
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:11,616
We've concluded that we ourselves 
are the most precious of all."

293
00:29:11,616 --> 00:29:18,884
Buddha told them 
they were correct indeed.

294
00:29:18,884 --> 00:29:26,022
Nowadays, we don't realize 
how precious we really are.

295
00:29:26,022 --> 00:29:30,405
We call them, "common mortals." 
who don’t know their preciousness.

296
00:29:30,405 --> 00:29:34,496
You are all suffering. 
Why do you suffer?

297
00:29:34,496 --> 00:29:40,096
It's because you're 
making yourself suffer.

298
00:29:40,096 --> 00:29:45,105
When I ask, "why are you suffering?" 
you say, "I broke up with my girlfriend."

299
00:29:45,105 --> 00:29:49,746
So I ask, "why are you suffering 
when you've broken up?"

300
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:52,577
"Because I've broken up, of course."

301
00:29:52,577 --> 00:29:55,126
"No, but why are you suffering 
for having broken up?"

302
00:29:55,126 --> 00:30:00,746
"Gosh, Sunim, you don't know anything. 
You've never dated," they say.

303
00:30:00,746 --> 00:30:05,537
"It doesn't matter if I've dated or not. 
The question is, why are you suffering for

304
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:09,476
having broken up? Is your ex-girlfriend 
stealing from you? Is she hitting you?

305
00:30:09,476 --> 00:30:12,088
Why does the break-up 
make you suffer?"

306
00:30:12,088 --> 00:30:15,638
"How can I not suffer 
after a break-up?"

307
00:30:15,638 --> 00:30:19,917
As you see, we cannot have 
a conversation. (Audience Laugh)

308
00:30:19,917 --> 00:30:28,828
I ask why he's suffering and 
he asks how it is possible not to suffer.

309
00:30:28,828 --> 00:30:35,339
So I say, "Do you need a new girlfriend? 
If so, meet someone else.

310
00:30:35,339 --> 00:30:45,499
If not, don't. Why is this 
something to suffer over?"

311
00:30:45,499 --> 00:30:49,326
"If she's with you, you're stuck 
with her for the rest of your life.

312
00:30:49,326 --> 00:30:53,152
Now that she's out of the picture, 
you can meet new girls.

313
00:30:53,152 --> 00:31:05,022
It's an opportunity. 
I'd be grinning if I were you."

314
00:31:05,022 --> 00:31:12,643
He says he's suffering 
because of the break-up,

315
00:31:12,643 --> 00:31:17,034
but he's actually suffering 
because he thinks he has to.

316
00:31:17,034 --> 00:31:21,753
Hence he says 
"How can I not suffer?"

317
00:31:21,753 --> 00:31:25,553
So after a few tries I say, 
"Well just go on and suffer then.

318
00:31:25,553 --> 00:31:33,983
If you enjoy suffering, 
suffer all you want."

319
00:31:33,983 --> 00:31:39,065
He's tormenting himself. 
He's giving himself an excuse to suffer.

320
00:31:39,065 --> 00:31:40,975
This is losing oneself.

321
00:31:40,975 --> 00:31:47,685
If we really hold ourselves precious, 
why would we torment ourselves?

322
00:31:47,685 --> 00:31:54,095
And yet we don't even realize 
we're tormenting ourselves.

323
00:31:54,095 --> 00:32:01,423
We consider ourselves as inferior, 
we call ourselves ugly and we suffer.

324
00:32:01,423 --> 00:32:05,495
We don't know 
how precious we really are.

325
00:32:05,495 --> 00:32:18,346
When Buddha came to this world and 
declared he alone is the Honored One,

326
00:32:18,346 --> 00:32:29,596
he means that each of us is the most 
precious and the most honored one.

327
00:32:29,596 --> 00:32:37,316
There is nothing that can replace us.

328
00:32:37,316 --> 00:32:41,110
And yet we don't live our lives this way.

329
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:47,248
We sell ourselves for a few bucks, 
we sell ourselves for ideology and belief.

330
00:32:47,248 --> 00:32:52,374
We live with no conscience awareness.

331
00:32:52,374 --> 00:32:57,980
Once we truly realize 
how precious we are,

332
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:04,890
we can no longer suffer 
even if we want to.

333
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:09,838
We call such a state of 
no suffering as 'Nirvana',

334
00:33:09,838 --> 00:33:15,008
and a state of freedom 
from bondage as ‘enlightenment’.

335
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:17,028
The one who attains 
this state is Buddha.

336
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:24,258
Buddha is the master of his own destiny, 
the master of the universe.

337
00:33:24,258 --> 00:33:32,584
We all have the right and 
potential to become one.

338
00:33:32,584 --> 00:33:39,179
And yet we give it all up 
and live like slaves.

339
00:33:39,179 --> 00:33:49,220
We should first and foremost 
never abuse ourselves.

340
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:52,600
Regardless of whether we are black 
or white, male or female,

341
00:33:52,600 --> 00:34:04,830
with or without disability, tall or short, 
regardless of our childhood experiences.

342
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:17,002
When a child is born, 
is he born into this world

343
00:34:17,002 --> 00:34:22,541
only through proper marriage?

344
00:34:22,541 --> 00:34:28,083
only through when you 
meet a desired spouse?

345
00:34:28,083 --> 00:34:40,716
He can be born into this world 
through rape as well, can he not?

346
00:34:40,732 --> 00:34:44,843
From a mother's point of view,

347
00:34:44,843 --> 00:34:50,923
she says "I didn't want this. 
I wasn't married, I was raped."

348
00:34:50,923 --> 00:34:57,022
But from the child's perspective, 
does it make any difference?

349
00:34:57,022 --> 00:35:02,123
Is it logical, then, 
to discriminate children

350
00:35:02,123 --> 00:35:05,869
because they are black, slaves,

351
00:35:05,869 --> 00:35:15,309
children of prostitutes 
or single moms? Is it logical?

352
00:35:18,979 --> 00:35:26,400
Nonetheless our society 
discriminates, does it not?

353
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:35,251
We are absolute precious beings.

354
00:35:35,251 --> 00:35:46,328
Ethics, morals, traditions 
cannot deny our very own dignity.

355
00:35:46,328 --> 00:35:52,451
Some babies are born with 
male and female genitalia.

356
00:35:52,451 --> 00:35:57,237
Some are born without either.

357
00:35:57,237 --> 00:36:00,181
Are they being punished for 
their bad deeds from former life?

358
00:36:00,181 --> 00:36:04,741
Is it God's punishment?

359
00:36:04,741 --> 00:36:11,143
Some children are born homosexual.

360
00:36:11,143 --> 00:36:19,352
They don't choose to be homosexual 
but their inclinations just work this way.

361
00:36:19,352 --> 00:36:29,112
Hating homosexuals is 
against the way of nature.

362
00:36:29,112 --> 00:36:33,072
In Christian terms, homophobia is 
against God's order of creation.

363
00:36:33,072 --> 00:36:38,963
If we're all God's creation, 
homosexuals are created by God as well.

364
00:36:38,963 --> 00:36:42,212
If we say homosexual people 
are God’s mistakes,

365
00:36:42,212 --> 00:36:52,003
then we're saying God makes mistakes, 
that he is fallible. Right?

366
00:36:52,003 --> 00:37:06,051
Any act of discrimination toward 
anybody violates the truth.

367
00:37:06,051 --> 00:37:08,544
This is the meaning 
of Buddha's first words,

368
00:37:08,544 --> 00:37:10,694
"In the Heavens above 
and Earth beneath,

369
00:37:10,694 --> 00:37:19,914
I alone am the honored one.” 
I am the most Precious One.

370
00:37:19,914 --> 00:37:23,984
And yet we don't live our lives this way.

371
00:37:23,984 --> 00:37:27,126
Today, on Buddha's birthday, 
we need to remember this truth.

372
00:37:27,126 --> 00:37:30,735
We should all recognize 
how precious we are.

373
00:37:30,735 --> 00:37:33,754
It doesn't matter whether 
you're married or not, young or old,

374
00:37:33,754 --> 00:37:39,457
with our without disabilities.

375
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:42,495
If you're missing an arm, 
that just makes life uncomfortable.

376
00:37:42,495 --> 00:37:45,405
That doesn't make you inferior.

377
00:37:45,405 --> 00:37:48,648
It should no longer matter 
who your parents are

378
00:37:48,648 --> 00:37:56,438
or you are illegitimate, 
not any more.

379
00:37:56,438 --> 00:38:00,736
Now, the clause that follows 
the first one is very important.

380
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:06,096
"All that exists in the Three Worlds is 
suffering, but I will bring comfort."

381
00:38:06,096 --> 00:38:16,327
The Three Worlds refers to the whole 
world. Everyone in this world.

382
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:23,617
"All that exists is suffering." Why? 
Because we have lost ourselves.

383
00:38:23,617 --> 00:38:33,287
Hence, Buddha is saying he has come 
to bring comfort to all beings.

384
00:38:33,287 --> 00:38:40,679
He's not saying he alone will become 
Buddha and live a free and happy life.

385
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:46,079
As a free and happy being,

386
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:55,458
he's saying he would guide others 
towards the same path.

387
00:38:55,458 --> 00:39:07,888
In Christian terms, he's saying he'll 
spread the gospel, the good news.

388
00:39:07,888 --> 00:39:13,389
Buddha says you should first 
become a free and happy being.

389
00:39:13,389 --> 00:39:20,449
Then, you should help others 
become free and happy too.

390
00:39:20,449 --> 00:39:27,010
Buddha's speech upon 
his birth represents

391
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:33,280
the fact that he lived 
his life with such purpose.

392
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:38,878
He became happy and 
he led others to be happy.

393
00:39:38,878 --> 00:39:41,918
In the same sense, 
what does Jungto vow to do?

394
00:39:41,918 --> 00:39:46,864
We vow to live as free individuals 
without suffering

395
00:39:46,864 --> 00:39:52,740
and contribute to the world around us.

396
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:56,501
In Mahayana Buddhism,

397
00:39:56,501 --> 00:40:00,939
this is expressed as 
上求菩堤 下化衆生 (sanggubori hahwajungsaeng)

398
00:40:00,939 --> 00:40:07,022
"To seek enlightenment from above 
while helping others from below"

399
00:40:07,022 --> 00:40:13,613
There are no differences in caring for 
oneself and caring for others.

400
00:40:13,613 --> 00:40:18,544
The two happens simultaneously. 
One does not come before the other.

401
00:40:18,544 --> 00:40:23,270
Buddha's birth story represents

402
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:35,683
this singular purpose of 
the life he lived.

403
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:48,433
On Buddha's birthday, 
we need to remember his teachings.

404
00:40:48,433 --> 00:40:53,063
Even in material abundance, 
we live in era of self-loss.

405
00:40:53,063 --> 00:40:58,744
There are three losses: 
losing ourselves as individuals,

406
00:40:58,744 --> 00:41:07,203
losing the sense of community 
and losing the natural environment.

407
00:41:07,203 --> 00:41:17,224
These are the three major maladies 
afflicting modern society.

408
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:30,094
Loss of self, loss of community, 
loss of nature.

409
00:41:30,094 --> 00:41:36,669
The very first step to recover 
these is to recover the 'self'.

410
00:41:36,669 --> 00:41:43,695
You should first all be happy 
and free, whatever you do.

411
00:41:43,695 --> 00:41:49,747
And that happiness must go 
beyond the individual into the community.

412
00:41:49,747 --> 00:41:53,605
This helps us recover 
the sense of community.

413
00:41:53,605 --> 00:41:57,090
No longer cause harm 
to others for my own benefit.

414
00:41:57,090 --> 00:42:03,335
What I do benefits both you and me. 
We both benefit from my actions.

415
00:42:03,335 --> 00:42:10,886
And as we recover the sense of community, 
we should stop destroying our environment.

416
00:42:10,886 --> 00:42:17,506
By destroying our environment, 
we are hurting ourselves, it is wrong.

417
00:42:17,506 --> 00:42:24,009
We need to coexist 
with nature in harmony.

418
00:42:24,009 --> 00:42:27,707
We call this sustainable development.

419
00:42:27,707 --> 00:42:31,527
There is a limit to development 
by destroying nature.

420
00:42:31,527 --> 00:42:45,808
Hence in order to continue our existence, 
we need to coexist with nature.

421
00:42:45,808 --> 00:42:50,528
This is the path we should take 
as we recover from modern society's ills.

422
00:42:50,528 --> 00:42:59,018
This is what Buddha proclaimed at birth.

423
00:42:59,018 --> 00:43:04,559
He declared it 2600 years ago.

424
00:43:04,559 --> 00:43:09,599
There are hundreds of millions 
more Buddhists nowadays,

425
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:15,633
and yet things haven't changed since.

426
00:43:15,633 --> 00:43:19,568
We call ourselves Buddhists only by name.

427
00:43:19,568 --> 00:43:23,079
We aren't following his words.

428
00:43:23,079 --> 00:43:30,506
We pray only for money, 
possessions, and spouses.

429
00:43:30,506 --> 00:43:35,349
We pray to do well 
on exams, to get elected, etc.

430
00:43:35,349 --> 00:43:40,636
We are seeking from him 
for secular desires.

431
00:43:40,636 --> 00:43:44,298
This has nothing to do with 
Buddha's teachings.

432
00:43:44,298 --> 00:43:48,228
So the fact that there are 
more Buddhists now

433
00:43:48,228 --> 00:43:50,546
does not mean that 
there are more happy people

434
00:43:50,546 --> 00:43:52,526
or that the world is a better place.

435
00:43:52,526 --> 00:43:57,401
Then what good is increasing 
the number of Buddhist?

436
00:43:57,401 --> 00:44:04,461
To compete with 
the number of Christians?

437
00:44:04,461 --> 00:44:13,382
We need to work on our quality as 
Buddhists. When we follow his teachings,

438
00:44:13,382 --> 00:44:17,351
it's a good thing 
if we increase in number.

439
00:44:17,351 --> 00:44:20,303
But if we forget 
what Buddha taught for us,

440
00:44:20,303 --> 00:44:23,303
increase in size means nothing.

441
00:44:23,303 --> 00:44:27,780
In today's society, 
people even ask me,

442
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:30,998
"Sunim, how is your temple doing?"

443
00:44:30,998 --> 00:44:35,768
What do they mean by "doing well"? 
It means many devotees.

444
00:44:35,768 --> 00:44:38,702
The temple also needs to have 
a lot of money, right?

445
00:44:38,702 --> 00:44:41,536
The temple also needs 
a big building, right?

446
00:44:41,536 --> 00:44:43,276
How is this question different from

447
00:44:43,276 --> 00:44:45,973
"How is your company doing?", 
"How is your shop doing?"

448
00:44:45,973 --> 00:44:49,060
This question about your shop means

449
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:53,270
if there are many customers 
and a lot of income.

450
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:56,384
It's all the same. It's because 
we live in a Capitalist society.

451
00:44:56,384 --> 00:45:07,294
Even religions have lost 
their directions.

452
00:45:07,294 --> 00:45:10,544
In a Capitalist world, religions 
follow the capitalist way.

453
00:45:10,544 --> 00:45:14,075
We say that socialist religion 
is not religion

454
00:45:14,075 --> 00:45:17,075
and that North Korea has no religion.

455
00:45:17,075 --> 00:45:21,282
We say Juche ideology has 
enslaved North Koreans.

456
00:45:21,282 --> 00:45:25,814
It's true. North Korea 
doesn't have religion.

457
00:45:25,814 --> 00:45:29,394
They are enslaved 
to the Juche ideologies.

458
00:45:29,394 --> 00:45:31,695
And yet there’s no difference.

459
00:45:31,695 --> 00:45:37,155
How our religions are enslaved 
under Capitalist ideologies.

460
00:45:37,155 --> 00:45:38,988
Some people even argue

461
00:45:38,988 --> 00:45:43,661
whether you can make more money 
by being Buddhist or Christian

462
00:45:43,665 --> 00:45:52,276
There is only one religion in our country.
We believe in the religion of money.

463
00:45:52,276 --> 00:45:58,916
Under the umbrella of money, 
we open shops of Christianity,

464
00:45:58,916 --> 00:46:05,316
Buddhism, etc. and compete for money.

465
00:46:05,316 --> 00:46:10,441
We have a monotheistic society. 
The same as North Koreans.

466
00:46:10,441 --> 00:46:15,859
What is that religion? 
The religion of money and capital.

467
00:46:15,859 --> 00:46:18,777
We assess our world as such.

468
00:46:18,777 --> 00:46:21,558
Give a loved one a present.

469
00:46:21,558 --> 00:46:24,987
Even when a mother gives her child 
a present, what does the child say?

470
00:46:24,987 --> 00:46:27,987
"Mom, how much did this cost?"

471
00:46:27,987 --> 00:46:32,916
We calculate love in monetary terms.

472
00:46:32,916 --> 00:46:40,460
When someone buys us clothes or shoes, 
what is the first thing we ask them?

473
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:46,302
"How much did you pay for this?" 
Don’t we ask that?

474
00:46:46,302 --> 00:46:52,471
If it's expensive, it's good. 
If it's cheap, it's bad.

475
00:46:52,471 --> 00:46:58,352
We're brainwashed with capitalism 
without realizing it.

476
00:46:58,352 --> 00:47:03,901
Just like North Koreans being 
brainwashed with their ideology.

477
00:47:03,901 --> 00:47:09,546
We have lost ourselves. 
We need to find ourselves again.

478
00:47:09,546 --> 00:47:12,823
This, Buddha has declared at birth.

479
00:47:12,823 --> 00:47:20,047
This is why Buddha came 
to this world on this very day.

480
00:47:20,047 --> 00:47:23,313
Are these stories meaningful to you?

481
00:47:23,313 --> 00:47:28,143
Or would you rather hear stories on 
how to make more money?

482
00:47:28,143 --> 00:47:32,543
In honor of Buddha's birthday, 
we need to reflect on our attitude

483
00:47:32,543 --> 00:47:39,023
toward the minorities in our society.

484
00:47:39,023 --> 00:47:43,937
We tend to discriminate these people

485
00:47:43,937 --> 00:47:48,637
without knowing, 
like North Korean defectors,

486
00:47:48,637 --> 00:47:53,145
Chinese Koreans, 
Vietnamese workers, refugees etc.

487
00:47:53,145 --> 00:47:56,224
I met those with disabilities 
a few days back - the blind,

488
00:47:56,224 --> 00:47:58,764
the deaf, and the crippled.

489
00:47:58,764 --> 00:48:05,205
They feel an enormous 
amount of discrimination.

490
00:48:05,205 --> 00:48:08,002
I talk to North Korean defectors

491
00:48:08,002 --> 00:48:11,512
and they confess how hard 
it is to live in South Korea.

492
00:48:11,512 --> 00:48:18,565
When we ask ourselves and 
don't think we discriminate them.

493
00:48:18,565 --> 00:48:21,485
Men never think 
they discriminate against women

494
00:48:21,485 --> 00:48:24,526
and yet women feel 
they are discriminated.

495
00:48:24,526 --> 00:48:31,496
There was a recent protest 
held by LGBT folks,

496
00:48:31,496 --> 00:48:36,476
and did we not discriminate 
and show disgust towards them?

497
00:48:36,476 --> 00:48:41,668
This is all wrong.

498
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:49,486
We should think that all beings born on 
this earth are precious in their own way.

499
00:48:49,486 --> 00:48:55,298
We should especially be more 
considerate towards minorities

500
00:48:55,298 --> 00:49:06,428
in terms of how we speak 
to and treat them.

501
00:49:06,428 --> 00:49:15,168
This is my request to you 
in honor of Buddha's birthday.
