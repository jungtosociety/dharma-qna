1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,010
Why Do We Live? to Give to Others?

2
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,511
Since I was young, 
I thought a lot about why we live.

3
00:00:11,556 --> 00:00:21,417
I came to the conclusion 
that we live to give to others.

4
00:00:21,452 --> 00:00:28,897
I think that gives reason to living.

5
00:00:28,947 --> 00:00:33,967
And I think that's necessary 
for everyone to be happy.

6
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:38,010
But when it comes to actually doing that, 
I have to consider my family.

7
00:00:38,043 --> 00:00:43,733
My family doesn't feel 
the same way as I do.

8
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:54,670
It's actually not easy 
for me to give as much as I can.

9
00:00:54,670 --> 00:01:02,230
And I don't think my wife and children 
are quite ready to do so.

10
00:01:02,301 --> 00:01:08,441
How much should I start giving back 
in this situation?

11
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:12,070
Your question doesn't quite make sense.

12
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:15,280
Why do we live?

13
00:01:15,328 --> 00:01:19,997
"We live to give."
That's not the answer.

14
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:24,977
Why do we live? 
We just do. That's the answer.

15
00:01:25,008 --> 00:01:27,285
Do you understand?

16
00:01:27,285 --> 00:01:29,425
We don't live because there's a reason.

17
00:01:29,475 --> 00:01:33,525
Will you die tonight 
if you have no reason to live?

18
00:01:33,572 --> 00:01:37,502
There is no reason for living.

19
00:01:37,522 --> 00:01:40,188
You're thinking wrong.

20
00:01:40,198 --> 00:01:43,828
You think you have to have a reason 
to keep living. That's not so.

21
00:01:43,857 --> 00:01:45,537
Before you think about any reason..

22
00:01:45,655 --> 00:01:49,525
Were you born for a reason? 
Or were you just born?

23
00:01:49,608 --> 00:01:50,988
You were just born.
People are just born first.

24
00:01:51,005 --> 00:01:56,965
Then they later try to find 
the reason for being born.

25
00:01:57,019 --> 00:02:01,159
Existence comes first. Always.
Do you understand?

26
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,700
So the question of why we live is 
not the right question in the first place.

27
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:07,788
Why do we live? 
We just do.

28
00:02:07,818 --> 00:02:10,468
If you must ask, we just live.

29
00:02:10,507 --> 00:02:13,077
If you still ask, we live 
because we're not dead.

30
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,390
(Audience laughs)

31
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,507
Why? 
Living comes first.

32
00:02:19,535 --> 00:02:23,927
Secondly, since we're living 
because we're not dead,

33
00:02:23,954 --> 00:02:26,694
how should we live?

34
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:30,340
How?

35
00:02:30,385 --> 00:02:33,193
Should we live in greed? 
Or should we give back to others?

36
00:02:33,193 --> 00:02:36,593
Should we live happily? Suffer? 
Or help others?

37
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,454
This concerns HOW we should live.

38
00:02:38,454 --> 00:02:41,155
Not WHY we live.

39
00:02:41,155 --> 00:02:43,165
How should we live?

40
00:02:43,187 --> 00:02:46,008
If you like being greedy, 
you can live that way.

41
00:02:46,008 --> 00:02:48,697
If you like giving back to others, 
you can live that way.

42
00:02:48,697 --> 00:02:51,127
But the point is this: 
That choice is secondary.

43
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:54,930
Giving back or not giving back 
is secondary.

44
00:02:54,971 --> 00:02:58,351
Living in happiness or in suffering 
is the key point.

45
00:02:58,412 --> 00:03:00,682
(Sunim) Are you sometimes unhappy?

46
00:03:00,684 --> 00:03:02,014
(Audience) We are.

47
00:03:02,014 --> 00:03:03,124
(Sunim) Do you like that or not? 
(Audience) We don't like it.

48
00:03:03,133 --> 00:03:05,542
(Sunim) Do you like being happy? 
(Audience) We like it.

49
00:03:05,542 --> 00:03:08,302
You like it, right? 
Everyone wants to be happy.

50
00:03:08,332 --> 00:03:11,279
Then what makes you happy? 
That's how we can look at it.

51
00:03:11,318 --> 00:03:15,008
Maybe giving back makes you happy.
Maybe just being the receiver

52
00:03:15,008 --> 00:03:21,546
makes you less happy. 
Then you can give back as you like.

53
00:03:21,546 --> 00:03:25,035
If receiving help from others 
makes you happy,

54
00:03:25,065 --> 00:03:28,835
then you can just do that. 
There is no set rule to which is right.

55
00:03:28,835 --> 00:03:31,675
(Questioner) Are you saying 
it's different for each person?

56
00:03:31,675 --> 00:03:34,634
You can do as you like. 
Whatever you like.

57
00:03:34,661 --> 00:03:37,591
So if you want to give back, you can.

58
00:03:37,669 --> 00:03:40,849
But if your wife is against it, 
Then giving back makes you happy,

59
00:03:40,849 --> 00:03:43,965
but it makes her unhappy 
and leads to fighting, right?

60
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:46,091
Then you have to weigh the two options.

61
00:03:46,091 --> 00:03:49,765
If the pleasure of giving back outweighs 
the pain of fighting with your wife,

62
00:03:49,765 --> 00:03:52,185
Then you can give back and not worry 
about how your wife feels.

63
00:03:52,185 --> 00:03:55,455
But if the pain of fighting with your wife 
outweighs the pleasure of giving back,

64
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,490
You shouldn't give back 
even if you want to.

65
00:03:59,534 --> 00:04:03,074
You have to make a compromise 
to live with your wife.

66
00:04:03,133 --> 00:04:05,793
That's life. 
There are no set rules.

67
00:04:05,836 --> 00:04:10,266
You shouldn't live only by the rules of ethics 
or morals for the sake of living by the rules.

68
00:04:10,266 --> 00:04:14,967
If you have a wife, 
you need to find what works for both of you.

69
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:17,943
There is no right or wrong.

70
00:04:17,943 --> 00:04:21,613
If you're not willing to make compromises, 
then you should live alone.

71
00:04:21,615 --> 00:04:26,025
To live together, you have to compromise.

72
00:04:26,051 --> 00:04:30,101
Life changes 
from living alone to living with someone.

73
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,720
You can't be the same person.

74
00:04:31,766 --> 00:04:33,586
For example, if you're a single man,

75
00:04:33,693 --> 00:04:38,093
you can have coffee with one woman one day 
and another woman the next.

76
00:04:38,121 --> 00:04:40,621
But once you marry, can you do that?

77
00:04:40,769 --> 00:04:41,669
No, you can't.

78
00:04:41,688 --> 00:04:44,062
"Why not? I'm a person."
You can't say that.

79
00:04:44,062 --> 00:04:45,122
(Audience laughs)

80
00:04:45,122 --> 00:04:51,822
Such a man shouldn't have the privilege of 
marrying or living with another person.

81
00:04:51,831 --> 00:04:55,917
All of you may get married, right?

82
00:04:55,917 --> 00:04:58,277
But once you become a monk, 
can you marry?

83
00:04:58,294 --> 00:04:59,134
You can't.

84
00:04:59,172 --> 00:05:01,468
"Why not? I'm a person."
You can't say that.

85
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:04,868
(Sunim) If you want to marry, 
don't be a monk and you can get married.

86
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:09,006
(Sunim) It's not that you can't marry. 
I'm saying you have to choose one or the other.

87
00:05:09,006 --> 00:05:11,190
You live to live accordingly. 
If you married,

88
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:16,157
you have to compromise with your wife, 
no matter what you want to do.

89
00:05:17,757 --> 00:05:22,442
(Questioner) I'm sorry to take
too much time, but I have another question.

90
00:05:22,504 --> 00:05:31,324
(Questioner) My aunt is unconscious 
and hospitalized right now.

91
00:05:31,357 --> 00:05:35,477
(Questioner) She has almost 
no chance of recovery.

92
00:05:35,545 --> 00:05:39,655
She's been on a respirator 
for 3 months now.

93
00:05:39,729 --> 00:05:47,889
If she's suffering so much for so long, 
is it better to take her off the respirator?

94
00:05:47,939 --> 00:05:49,624
No.

95
00:05:49,624 --> 00:05:56,504
Even if the family comes to an agreement 
to take her off the respirator,

96
00:05:56,508 --> 00:06:00,628
if the doctor says he can't do that 
because of hospital policy, you can't.

97
00:06:00,649 --> 00:06:06,401
If the family agrees, 
you may ask the doctor to take her off.

98
00:06:06,401 --> 00:06:09,961
But if your family can't come 
to an agreement, the doctor can't do that.

99
00:06:10,024 --> 00:06:12,731
It's not something 
you can decide on your own.

100
00:06:12,731 --> 00:06:16,001
If you want her off,
you have to discuss it with your family.

101
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:18,871
If your family agrees, 
then you have to consult the doctor.

102
00:06:18,871 --> 00:06:21,738
But if the hospital policy doesn't allow it,
you can't do it.

103
00:06:21,778 --> 00:06:25,098
Do you understand?

104
00:06:25,098 --> 00:06:27,228
So, apart from the question of why or how,

105
00:06:27,228 --> 00:06:30,415
You discuss it with the family and 
decide based on how they feel,

106
00:06:30,415 --> 00:06:34,595
rather than how the patient feels.

107
00:06:34,614 --> 00:06:38,134
Why? 
Because the patient is not conscious.

108
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:42,518
You can discuss with family and 
make a decision with the doctor.

109
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,438
(Questioner) Okay. Thank you.

110
00:06:44,438 --> 00:06:47,168
(Audience Applause)
