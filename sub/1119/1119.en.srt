00:00:03,103 --> 00:00:08,679
Qualifications for a Good Spouse

2
00:00:13,918 --> 00:00:21,166
My question is what are the 
qualifications to be a good spouse?

3
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:26,948
I guess I'm past my prime age 
for getting married.

4
00:00:26,948 --> 00:00:32,246
Regarding marriage, I've had 
this vague idea since I was young that

5
00:00:32,246 --> 00:00:35,623
as long as my partner and I have 
the same values and pursuits,

6
00:00:35,623 --> 00:00:39,914
it can be happy marriage.

7
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:42,383
But, as I reached a marrying age, 


8
00:00:42,383 --> 00:00:45,864
I found myself seeking advice 
from people around me.

9
00:00:45,864 --> 00:00:48,984
The bottom line was 
about the material things.

10
00:00:48,984 --> 00:00:54,194
They said, 
"A man should have at least this much."

11
00:00:54,242 --> 00:00:55,653
They say, 


12
00:00:55,653 --> 00:01:02,507
"Unless you are financially well 
prepared, you cannot be happy."

13
00:01:02,507 --> 00:01:07,224
Although I have my own values, 
it's hard to deny such things

14
00:01:07,224 --> 00:01:08,985
as I get older.

15
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:15,818
I ask for your advice on how 
I should respond to such advice.

16
00:01:15,818 --> 00:01:18,129
The qualifications of marriage...

17
00:01:18,129 --> 00:01:24,263
First, one has to be 
over 17-18 years of age.

18
00:01:24,263 --> 00:01:27,152
(Questioner) Yes.

19
00:01:27,152 --> 00:01:31,267
That's legally.

20
00:01:31,267 --> 00:01:36,163
Biologically, one has to be 
over 15 or 16.

21
00:01:36,163 --> 00:01:42,354
Legally and ethically speaking, 
one needs to be over 20.

22
00:01:42,354 --> 00:01:43,852
Do you understand?

23
00:01:43,852 --> 00:01:45,923
This is the qualification of marriage.

24
00:01:45,923 --> 00:01:49,457
(Audience Laughter)

25
00:01:49,457 --> 00:01:57,144
Next, the qualification of the mind 
is the most important.

26
00:01:57,144 --> 00:02:02,643
You have to know 
how to adjust to the other person.

27
00:02:02,643 --> 00:02:06,004
You have to be willing to
make adjustments.

28
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,162
If you want to go, 
but your partner doesn't,

29
00:02:10,162 --> 00:02:14,321
you should be prepared not to go.

30
00:02:14,321 --> 00:02:18,893
If you want to go to the beach, but your 
partner wants to go to the mountain,

31
00:02:18,893 --> 00:02:23,597
you should be willing 
to go to the mountain.

32
00:02:23,597 --> 00:02:26,682
This is the most critical 
qualification of marriage...

33
00:02:26,682 --> 00:02:29,493
being able to adjust.

34
00:02:29,493 --> 00:02:32,114
So, unless you are ready 
to adjust to the other person,

35
00:02:32,114 --> 00:02:35,572
you should not get married.

36
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:41,313
You don't need adjustment 
to have sex only.

37
00:02:41,313 --> 00:02:43,355
Animals don't adjust for each other

38
00:02:43,355 --> 00:02:51,243
because they only copulate 
to preserve their own species.

39
00:02:51,243 --> 00:02:55,863
They don't need such things 
like a marriage relationship.

40
00:02:55,863 --> 00:02:58,799
So, animals don't need to 
prepare to make adjustments.

41
00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:02,052
But, marriage is a community.

42
00:03:02,052 --> 00:03:08,562
Two people living together, 


43
00:03:08,562 --> 00:03:15,302
whether they are two men, 
two women, or a man and a woman,

44
00:03:15,302 --> 00:03:20,503
is different from animals living together.

45
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,619
Even two men living together 
as roommates

46
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,704
is a community, like a marriage.

47
00:03:24,712 --> 00:03:30,936
If a man and a woman live together 
just to copulate,

48
00:03:30,936 --> 00:03:35,212
it's at the level of animal nature.

49
00:03:35,212 --> 00:03:39,036
But, the essence of marriage 
doesn't lie in copulation,

50
00:03:39,036 --> 00:03:42,861
but in forming a community.

51
00:03:42,861 --> 00:03:45,373
People form cooperative relationships

52
00:03:45,373 --> 00:03:48,623
because living together is 
better than living alone.

53
00:03:48,623 --> 00:03:52,793
And the reproduction 
for the preservation of species

54
00:03:52,793 --> 00:03:56,964
is added to marriage.

55
00:03:56,964 --> 00:04:07,341
That's why one has to be over 15 
or 20 from the biological point of view.

56
00:04:07,341 --> 00:04:11,102
From a community point of view, 
one has to learn to adjust.

57
00:04:11,102 --> 00:04:14,952
Are you ready to adjust
to the other person?

58
00:04:14,952 --> 00:04:19,201
Are you willing to go 
to the beach for your spouse

59
00:04:19,201 --> 00:04:26,264
even you want to go to the mountain?

60
00:04:26,264 --> 00:04:27,294
(Questioner) Yes.

61
00:04:27,294 --> 00:04:30,432
(Audience Laughter)

62
00:04:30,432 --> 00:04:34,315
People are laughing 
at your quick answer.

63
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:37,753
Why? 
Because it's hard to do in real life.

64
00:04:37,758 --> 00:04:40,952
(Audience Laughter)

65
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:44,347
Trouble starts with a very small thing.

66
00:04:44,347 --> 00:04:48,860
Trouble starts if the wife likes to hang 
her clothes in the closet

67
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,584
the moment she takes it off,

68
00:04:51,604 --> 00:04:57,785
but the husband leaves it 
wherever he takes it off.

69
00:04:57,785 --> 00:05:04,241
The husband says 
his wife's cooking lacks salt

70
00:05:04,241 --> 00:05:10,698
while she thinks it's just right.

71
00:05:10,698 --> 00:05:13,443
And she accuses him 
for having a salty diet.

72
00:05:13,443 --> 00:05:17,012
Conflicts arise from 
these kinds of things.

73
00:05:17,012 --> 00:05:20,746
One person says the room is too 
hot while the other says it's too cold.

74
00:05:20,746 --> 00:05:27,953
"Turn on the AC." "No, turn it off." 
Same thing with cleaning the house.

75
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:35,854
One insists the other 
to take a shower before bedtime,

76
00:05:35,854 --> 00:05:44,086
while the other says taking a shower 
once every three days is enough.

77
00:05:44,086 --> 00:05:52,315
Marriage is difficult due to this 
kind of conflicts, not the other stuff.

78
00:05:52,315 --> 00:05:58,673
You don't need to own a condo or a car. 
They are secondary.

79
00:05:58,673 --> 00:06:04,544
Marriages fail these days 
no matter how well they prepare for it

80
00:06:04,569 --> 00:06:08,445
because people place those 
secondary things at the center,

81
00:06:08,445 --> 00:06:12,315
those are irrelevant to marriage.

82
00:06:12,315 --> 00:06:17,662
In some cases, they break up 
during wedding preparations.

83
00:06:17,662 --> 00:06:24,589
In other cases, the couples get divorced 
upon returning from their honeymoon.

84
00:06:24,589 --> 00:06:30,177
What you call 
the qualifications of marriage

85
00:06:30,177 --> 00:06:35,766
are actually irrelevant to married life.

86
00:06:35,766 --> 00:06:43,673
Animals live and raise their young 
even in such a small nest under a tree.

87
00:06:43,673 --> 00:06:47,178
How did our ancestors live?

88
00:06:47,178 --> 00:06:49,762
Did they have everything ready 
before getting married?

89
00:06:49,762 --> 00:06:56,922
No. You don't need to have 
any material things ready.

90
00:06:56,922 --> 00:07:01,175
Let's say you each 
live in studio apartments.

91
00:07:01,175 --> 00:07:08,362
By living together, 
you already save one rent, right?

92
00:07:08,362 --> 00:07:13,330
How about dining tables? 
You don't need two, so you save on one.

93
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:15,800
So you benefit.

94
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,541
Also, instead of each 
cleaning a room daily,

95
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:23,283
you take turns, 
so one rest for a day.

96
00:07:23,283 --> 00:07:31,287
Sharing all the duties like this 
brings benefits to life.

97
00:07:31,287 --> 00:07:38,993
A baby grows with a mother's love, 
not a fancy cradle.

98
00:07:38,993 --> 00:07:41,282
A baby doesn't need 
Japanese baby formula

99
00:07:41,282 --> 00:07:43,572
or Japanese diapers.

100
00:07:43,572 --> 00:07:49,916
Babies don't know such things.

101
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:53,659
Marriages fail 
because we are concerned about

102
00:07:53,659 --> 00:07:57,403
what is irrelevant to marriage.

103
00:07:57,403 --> 00:08:05,265
So, are you willing to adjust for 
the person you are going to marry?

104
00:08:05,265 --> 00:08:10,573
A pretty person is nice 
when you are just dating, but,

105
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:16,345
the one you will live together must 
have practical abilities for daily living.

106
00:08:16,345 --> 00:08:21,844
A woman knows how to cook, 
and a man helps with house cleaning.

107
00:08:21,844 --> 00:08:26,584
These things are important in 
marriage because it is communal living.

108
00:08:26,584 --> 00:08:32,904
There's a saying that even a pretty 
flower looks good only for a day or two.

109
00:08:32,904 --> 00:08:40,141
A rag is for cleaning, 
so it should absorb water to clean dirt.

110
00:08:40,141 --> 00:08:43,975
What would happen 
if you made a nice rag out of gold?

111
00:08:43,975 --> 00:08:45,813
Would it clean well or not?

112
00:08:45,813 --> 00:08:47,473
It would not.

113
00:08:47,473 --> 00:08:50,780
You will have to leave 
the gold rag at home

114
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,180
and go borrow one that absorbs water.

115
00:08:53,180 --> 00:09:02,455
That's why some men have affairs 
after marrying a pretty woman.

116
00:09:02,455 --> 00:09:04,883
The same applies to women.

117
00:09:04,883 --> 00:09:10,124
What happens to a woman 
who marries into a rich family?

118
00:09:10,124 --> 00:09:15,961
You might think a woman does well, 
if she marries up in social status to

119
00:09:15,961 --> 00:09:26,143
a son of a governor, high-ranking 
academic, high government official,

120
00:09:26,143 --> 00:09:36,904
a politician or a rich man.

121
00:09:36,904 --> 00:09:41,379
But, the woman would be 
treated almost like a maid instead of

122
00:09:41,379 --> 00:09:46,640
being accepted as a member 
of the family or a daughter-in-law.

123
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:52,214
Her life would be 
a servant obeying a master.

124
00:09:52,214 --> 00:09:54,714
So, her spirit withers.

125
00:09:54,714 --> 00:09:59,183
She has to follow her 
in-laws decisions on everything.

126
00:09:59,183 --> 00:10:05,673
On the other hand, a woman 
who marries into a poor family with

127
00:10:05,673 --> 00:10:12,534
not much education, 
would be treated with respect.

128
00:10:12,534 --> 00:10:15,933
I'm not saying that's 100% the case. 
But, generally that's how it is.

129
00:10:15,933 --> 00:10:21,173
In other words, you have to consider 
how much freedom you would have.

130
00:10:21,173 --> 00:10:27,093
Do you want to be a servant 
who gets to spend money?

131
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:35,047
Or, do you want to be your own master 
living a simple life in a small house?

132
00:10:35,047 --> 00:10:39,330
Most women say they want 
to be their own masters,

133
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:43,614
but choose to be servants.

134
00:10:43,614 --> 00:10:49,573
Most of those women score low 
on marriage satisfaction surveys.

135
00:10:49,573 --> 00:10:53,595
Almost all of them 
suffer from depression.

136
00:10:53,595 --> 00:10:56,566
So, first, are you ready to 
adjust to the other person?

137
00:10:56,566 --> 00:11:05,234
Second, until now, you were 
your mother's son, your father's son.

138
00:11:05,234 --> 00:11:10,163
But, once you get married, 
you become a husband to a woman.

139
00:11:10,163 --> 00:11:15,584
Being a mother's son and 
a woman's husband at the same time,

140
00:11:15,584 --> 00:11:21,419
is like having a mistress on the side.

141
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:24,124
You have to abandon one woman.

142
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:29,553
A married woman 
is a stranger to her family.

143
00:11:29,586 --> 00:11:32,653
This old idea is good, 
even it is not held any longer.

144
00:11:32,653 --> 00:11:36,749
The problem is for men 
not being able to sever his family ties.

145
00:11:36,749 --> 00:11:40,502
Men don’t sever their ties, 
so I tell them to cut them off.

146
00:11:40,502 --> 00:11:51,253
Young women these days rely on 
their parents support after her marriage.

147
00:11:51,253 --> 00:11:54,904
The more a man marries up, 
the more he suffers,

148
00:11:54,904 --> 00:12:00,603
due to his in-laws' involvement.

149
00:12:00,603 --> 00:12:06,334
Adjusting to one’s spouse 
is hard enough.

150
00:12:06,334 --> 00:12:20,592
It makes the married life very difficult, 
if you have to adjust to in-laws also.

151
00:12:20,592 --> 00:12:24,255
It's like South and North Korea. 
It's hard enough to adjust to each other,

152
00:12:24,255 --> 00:12:27,099
but, we have to adjust to the U.S. 
behind South Korea

153
00:12:27,099 --> 00:12:29,943
and China behind North Korea.

154
00:12:29,943 --> 00:12:34,192
What does this mean? It means 
we have not yet gained independence.

155
00:12:34,192 --> 00:12:40,154
We are like a subordinate state 
subject to powerful nations.

156
00:12:40,154 --> 00:12:45,285
Most of today's sons and daughters 
are like the subordinate states.

157
00:12:45,285 --> 00:12:52,075
They are prone to divisions and conflicts 
under the influence of strong powers.

158
00:12:52,075 --> 00:13:03,073
When you are unsure, 
it's better to live alone like me.

159
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:08,863
You shouldn't marry 
just because others do.

160
00:13:08,992 --> 00:13:18,524
Second, you should take a clear stance 
as the man responsible for the family.

161
00:13:18,524 --> 00:13:21,662
The same applies to women.

162
00:13:21,662 --> 00:13:27,441
You can't maintain your new family 
if you habitually depend on your parents

163
00:13:27,441 --> 00:13:38,447
economically or psychologically 
as you did as a child.

164
00:13:38,447 --> 00:13:42,855
It's like a company makes its own 
decisions after gaining independence.

165
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:46,173
Don't get married 
if you don't have this mindset.

166
00:13:46,173 --> 00:13:49,405
This is the important part of 
marriage preparation.

167
00:13:49,451 --> 00:13:51,803
The family background, the type of car,

168
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:53,750
and the type of job are all secondary.

169
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,723
Make adjustments for each other 
and take small steps together.

170
00:13:56,723 --> 00:14:04,343
(Questioner) Thank you.

171
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:08,336
Those of you suffering 
from your marriage

172
00:14:08,336 --> 00:14:11,364
wish you had heard this 
before getting married, right?

173
00:14:11,364 --> 00:14:14,174
Do you know what we call it?

174
00:14:14,174 --> 00:14:18,304
To put it nicely, 
"You are like a rat who ate rat poison."

175
00:14:18,304 --> 00:14:21,135
Don't blame anybody else.

176
00:14:21,135 --> 00:14:25,443
You are all hurting yourselves.
