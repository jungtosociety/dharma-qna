1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,474
Why do we do 108 prostrations?

2
00:00:15,192 --> 00:00:19,763
It’s nice to meet you, Sunim.
(Sunim) Yes.

3
00:00:19,779 --> 00:00:25,645
While listening to your Dharma talks,
(Sunim) Yes.

4
00:00:25,645 --> 00:00:33,599
I noticed you mention 
108 prostrations quite often.

5
00:00:33,611 --> 00:00:38,188
I may be asking this question because
I don’t know much about Buddhism,

6
00:00:38,207 --> 00:00:43,319
but I wonder if prostration is merely
a Buddhist ritual.

7
00:00:43,338 --> 00:00:55,710
Why do you recommend we do 108 prostrations
if it isn’t just for physical exercise?

8
00:00:55,075 --> 00:00:59,151
I don’t have a basic understanding of why 
we prostration as part of our practice.

9
00:00:59,161 --> 00:01:01,504
I'd like to know.
(Sunim) Yes.

10
00:01:02,289 --> 00:01:09,841
Let’s say you and I are lying in bed, 
and we start to argue about something.

11
00:01:09,853 --> 00:01:12,760
I might shout at you 
“What? That’s not right.”

12
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:17,292
If the argument became that heated,

13
00:01:17,292 --> 00:01:20,753
would we continue to lie there 
or would we sit up?

14
00:01:20,753 --> 00:01:21,953
Please tell me

15
00:01:21,955 --> 00:01:24,255
(Questioner) We would sit bolt upright.

16
00:01:24,437 --> 00:01:25,795
That’s right.

17
00:01:25,795 --> 00:01:29,328
What about if we were sitting in a chair 
and talking and began to argue heatedly?

18
00:01:29,328 --> 00:01:32,370
Would we continue to sit in the chair or 
would we stand up as we became aggravated?

19
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:33,856
(Questioner) We would stand up.

20
00:01:33,856 --> 00:01:40,569
Right. When we both stand up and the argument
intensifies even more, do we look up or down?

21
00:01:40,585 --> 00:01:42,232
(Audience Laughter)

22
00:01:42,251 --> 00:01:43,572
We look up.

23
00:01:43,572 --> 00:01:46,491
Do we close our eyes or 
keep them wide open?

24
00:01:46,491 --> 00:01:47,490
(Audience Laughter)

25
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:48,497
Our eyes are wide open.

26
00:01:48,497 --> 00:01:51,535
We might shout at each other
“What? What nonsense!”

27
00:01:51,535 --> 00:01:57,135
We jump up onto our feet, 
stiffen our necks,

28
00:01:57,135 --> 00:02:00,144
look up and widen our eyes

29
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:07,764
This is the body language of someone who is
strongly caught up in the notion that he is right.

30
00:02:08,544 --> 00:02:10,782
What does your getting upset imply?

31
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:13,695
It implies that you are right,
and the other person is wrong.

32
00:02:13,695 --> 00:02:18,950
Then thoughts like, 
“Oops, maybe it was my mistake”

33
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:24,844
or “Maybe I misunderstood you” 
pop into your mind.

34
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:33,412
Your eyes lose their glare and 
you lower your gaze and your head.

35
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:38,892
You may progress to saying,
“I’m sorry” or “it was my fault.”

36
00:02:39,298 --> 00:02:41,555
What if you feel even worse 
about your mistake?

37
00:02:41,555 --> 00:02:44,393
You would bend your upper body and say,
“I am really sorry.”

38
00:02:44,462 --> 00:02:46,919
What if you feel like the mistake 
you made is unforgivable?

39
00:02:47,182 --> 00:02:50,335
You would kneel down.

40
00:02:50,767 --> 00:02:55,101
Then what? You would lower
your head to the floor.

41
00:02:55,670 --> 00:03:00,898
This is the body’s way of expressing penance. 
Do you understand?

42
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:01,842
(Questioner) Yes, yes.

43
00:03:02,989 --> 00:03:07,760
When you kneel down and 
put your forehead on the floor

44
00:03:08,215 --> 00:03:13,137
that is the body’s way of expressing you 
completely let go of the notion that you are right.

45
00:03:13,162 --> 00:03:19,152
Standing up is the way your body most strongly 
expresses your ego, the idea that I am right.

46
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:24,720
So, prostration is a way to express with your body 
that there is nothing to insist you are right.

47
00:03:24,652 --> 00:03:27,128
When you kneel down on the floor, 
you are physically expressing,

48
00:03:27,139 --> 00:03:34,367
“I am sorry. I made a mistake. There was nothing
I could insist that I was right about.”

49
00:03:35,123 --> 00:03:38,675
There are three benefits to prostrating

50
00:03:38,675 --> 00:03:45,714
First, when you bend down and put your 
forehead on the floor and then stand up again,

51
00:03:45,717 --> 00:03:48,394
it exercises your whole body.

52
00:03:49,135 --> 00:03:52,926
For this reason, prostration is the most 
effective form of whole-body exercise.

53
00:03:52,945 --> 00:03:59,510
So, if you have only twenty minutes to exercise,
prostration is the best one to choose.

54
00:04:00,213 --> 00:04:02,784
First, it is beneficial physically.

55
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:06,342
Other exercises only have physical benefits 
but prostration can also help you reduce stress.

56
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:11,566
Because it helps you let go of your ego, 
of the notion that you are right

57
00:04:11,566 --> 00:04:14,747
and this produces psychological effects.

58
00:04:14,747 --> 00:04:19,185
Stress is produced 
when you insist you are right.

59
00:04:19,186 --> 00:04:23,649
You don’t become stressed 
when you acknowledge your faults.

60
00:04:23,658 --> 00:04:28,467
People in modern society deal with a lot 
of stress due to their strong ego.

61
00:04:28,467 --> 00:04:35,507
Prostration is beneficial as a way for people 
to deal with stress in modern society.

62
00:04:36,754 --> 00:04:40,335
It is still beneficial even if 
you are forced to do it.

63
00:04:40,345 --> 00:04:48,345
It is even better if you prostrate repeating 
words that can train your mind.

64
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:56,754
This is what we call words for practice 
or words for prayer.

65
00:04:56,803 --> 00:05:03,165
For example, 
let’s say you are anxious,

66
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:05,797
and you pray to God to 
make your mind peaceful.

67
00:05:06,471 --> 00:05:09,195
This is asking someone to do 
a favor for you, right?

68
00:05:09,197 --> 00:05:10,931
That’s not how words for practice works.

69
00:05:10,931 --> 00:05:15,759
Instead, when you prostrate,
repeat “Thank you, God. I am at peace.”

70
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,302
Sending a message like this to your 
unconscious is how it should be done.

71
00:05:19,302 --> 00:05:24,899
Performing 108 prostrations repeats that 
message to yourself 108 times.

72
00:05:25,403 --> 00:05:30,990
Let’s say you are having issues in your 
relationship with your husband.

73
00:05:30,118 --> 00:05:33,689
Although the words for practice may be 
different based on the situation,

74
00:05:33,689 --> 00:05:37,623
let’s assume you were given the words,
“you are right. I have flaws. I am sorry”

75
00:05:37,623 --> 00:05:40,133
You would be prostrating
with those words.

76
00:05:40,133 --> 00:05:42,481
Usually, when your husband expresses 
his opinions to you,

77
00:05:42,493 --> 00:05:45,700
your automatic response to his words 
is that he is wrong.

78
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:48,773
But if you continue your practice with 
the practice words,

79
00:05:48,773 --> 00:05:52,332
one day you will find yourself listening to 
him without having an automatic judgement.

80
00:05:52,332 --> 00:05:56,227
You will think “well, I can see his point”
and start simply accepting his words.

81
00:05:56,227 --> 00:05:59,684
This kind of thing can happen 
when you prostate.

82
00:05:59,684 --> 00:06:04,761
But it doesn’t really matter if you prostrate
100 times, 103 times, or 108 times.

83
00:06:04,761 --> 00:06:09,304
What do we traditionally call defilements?

84
00:06:09,304 --> 00:06:12,380
We call them the 108 defilements, right?

85
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:16,872
So, we do 108 prostrations to get rid of
the 108 defilements.

86
00:06:16,895 --> 00:06:22,285
I tell Christians that 
if you prostrate to the Buddha,

87
00:06:22,294 --> 00:06:26,170
it may be seen as worshiping an idol 
which is against the Ten Commandment,

88
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:28,465
but it isn’t.

89
00:06:28,465 --> 00:06:35,885
Prostrating is about repenting 
your own flaws to yourself,

90
00:06:35,885 --> 00:06:38,370
not praying to another God-like figure.

91
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:42,500
I don’t think prostration goes against the
principles of Christianity.

92
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,602
But if they insist that 
it is against their principle,

93
00:06:45,602 --> 00:06:47,660
I tell them to do 103 prostrations 
instead.

94
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,256
Why 103 prostrations?

95
00:06:51,215 --> 00:06:55,251
How many Christians were persecuted 
when Christianity was oppressed in Korea,

96
00:06:55,252 --> 00:06:59,118
and how many of those became regarded 
as Christian saints by the Vatican?

97
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:02,508
Aren’t there 103 Korean saints 
registered at the Vatican?

98
00:07:02,512 --> 00:07:07,207
So, if you are a Christian and the 108 
prostrations make you uncomfortable,

99
00:07:07,207 --> 00:07:09,732
do 103 prostrations to each of the saints.

100
00:07:09,732 --> 00:07:15,323
But don’t get jealous because 103 is 
5 less than 108.

101
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:19,112
(Audience Laughter)

102
00:07:19,112 --> 00:07:24,702
My point is that prostration doesn’t go 
against whatever belief you have.

103
00:07:24,762 --> 00:07:29,504
Even if you are a protestant, this does
not go against Christian beliefs.

104
00:07:29,529 --> 00:07:33,157
That's how you should approach 
prostration.

105
00:07:33,157 --> 00:07:36,217
So, if we prostrate 10 times 
the 108 prostrations?

106
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:38,184
That is 1080 prostrations.

107
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,320
How about 30 times? 
That is 3000 prostrations.

108
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:44,494
How about 100 times 108 prostrations? 
That is 10000 prostrations.

109
00:07:44,494 --> 00:07:49,354
If perform 108 prostrations times 10,
that is 1080 prostrations,

110
00:07:49,673 --> 00:07:53,644
but once the count passes 1080,
we don’t say 3024 prostrations, etc.

111
00:07:53,644 --> 00:07:55,511
We just say 3000 prostrations.

112
00:07:55,511 --> 00:08:00,130
Doing 3000 prostrations or 10000
prostrations is physically challenging.

113
00:08:00,177 --> 00:08:04,282
Prostration that many times contains 
an aspect of discipline.

114
00:08:04,338 --> 00:08:08,223
Many people who attempt to prostrate that 
many times give up in the middle.

115
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:11,838
But if you push through, 
even while physically suffering,

116
00:08:11,877 --> 00:08:16,477
there are many thoughts that 
arise in your mind.

117
00:08:16,477 --> 00:08:19,458
In the beginning you may focus on your words
for practice and repent towards your husband,

118
00:08:19,473 --> 00:08:22,307
but as you become tired, other thoughts 
might creep in, “what have I done wrong?”

119
00:08:22,307 --> 00:08:24,316
Those thoughts drive you to feel more 
resentment towards your husband.

120
00:08:24,316 --> 00:08:27,535
Then you calm down and feel that 
maybe it wasn’t all his fault.

121
00:08:27,535 --> 00:08:30,773
Your mind changes like that numerous 
times during your prostration.

122
00:08:30,773 --> 00:08:37,514
This process will lead you to let go of 
your notion that you are right.

123
00:08:37,524 --> 00:08:39,874
As your mind softens, 
you start thinking

124
00:08:39,874 --> 00:08:42,678
“he must have felt this way and 
that’s why he acted like that,”

125
00:08:42,678 --> 00:08:47,466
and you develop an understanding of where your 
spouse is coming from when he acts a certain way.

126
00:08:47,466 --> 00:08:49,939
When you reach this understanding 
while prostrating,

127
00:08:49,939 --> 00:08:53,160
you start accepting another’s point of view 
and that unlocks your mind which releases stress.

128
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,391
For example, when you say, 
“I don’t know why you behave like that,”

129
00:08:55,391 --> 00:08:58,480
your voice gets higher 
because you feel more stress.

130
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:01,740
“I don’t know” is also a cause for stress.

131
00:09:01,503 --> 00:09:04,674
But when you come to understand someone 
and say “Oh, that’s why he behaved like that,”

132
00:09:04,674 --> 00:09:06,281
it releases your stress.

133
00:09:06,309 --> 00:09:10,700
That shows your understanding
of the other person.

134
00:09:10,124 --> 00:09:12,838
That’s why we practice with words

135
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:16,772
that help us understand the other instead 
of trying to be understood by them.

136
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:19,551
You get stressed when you try to 
be understood by others.

137
00:09:19,553 --> 00:09:22,809
When you develop an understanding of other
people, your mind becomes free from stress.

138
00:09:22,834 --> 00:09:24,710
That’s why we practice prostration.

139
00:09:25,173 --> 00:09:31,648
It is possible to do an autosuggestion 
without performing such physical work.

140
00:09:31,689 --> 00:09:35,689
While comfortably sitting, you can tell 
yourself I am at peace,

141
00:09:35,689 --> 00:09:39,366
but this message doesn’t get delivered to 
your subconscious world easily.

142
00:09:39,504 --> 00:09:41,618
However, when you prostrate, 
you will sweat

143
00:09:41,618 --> 00:09:44,951
and develop a feeling of resistance 
toward doing the prostration,

144
00:09:44,953 --> 00:09:49,200
but if you continue to prostrate despite 
such difficulty, what does that mean?

145
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:55,174
You can’t continue unless you are 
determined to change your karma.

146
00:09:55,893 --> 00:10:00,274
That’s why we suggest doing 
the 108 prostrations in the morning.

147
00:10:00,274 --> 00:10:06,664
Prostrating 108 times has nothing to do
with asking God to bless you.

148
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:12,650
It has nothing to do 
with any religious implications.

149
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:17,345
It is just a very effective 
therapeutic tool.

150
00:10:17,345 --> 00:10:21,993
To sum up: first, it’s very beneficial 
for your physical health

151
00:10:22,261 --> 00:10:28,595
Second, it helps you to 
break down your ego.

152
00:10:29,121 --> 00:10:33,407
Third, if you prostrate while 
repeating words for practice,

153
00:10:33,652 --> 00:10:37,556
you can make changes 
to your subconscious,

154
00:10:37,556 --> 00:10:40,680
which will free you 
from the stresses of life.
