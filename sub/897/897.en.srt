1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,243
I Can't Stay Put at One Job; 
I Lose Interest and Keep Moving Around.

2
00:00:09,273 --> 00:00:11,382
Nice to meet you. Sunim

3
00:00:11,382 --> 00:00:17,811
I have worked in a variety of areas

4
00:00:17,811 --> 00:00:21,856
not being able to choose 
one particular field to focus on

5
00:00:21,856 --> 00:00:29,343
because I have diverse interests 
but I tend to feel that

6
00:00:29,343 --> 00:00:33,013
when I settle in one job
I find the work to be without much merit.

7
00:00:33,013 --> 00:00:39,413
I tend to conclude that the work is 
not necessarily helpful for the world.

8
00:00:39,413 --> 00:00:44,644
So, I lose interest after a short time.

9
00:00:44,644 --> 00:00:49,465
Even now I feel somewhat doubtful
about the work I recently started.

10
00:00:49,465 --> 00:00:53,060
What I would like to ask you is: 
should one accept

11
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:57,835
that all works/jobs are about the same

12
00:00:57,855 --> 00:01:06,866
or should one continue to search
for better and different work.

13
00:01:08,206 --> 00:01:12,224
When you go to a mountain, 
you see some squirrels, right?

14
00:01:12,224 --> 00:01:15,454
You see that the squirrels climb up trees

15
00:01:15,454 --> 00:01:20,164
and jump over the rocks and things, 
right?

16
00:01:20,627 --> 00:01:23,745
Do the squirrels complain 
that some trees are too tall

17
00:01:23,745 --> 00:01:26,144
or some rocks are too big?

18
00:01:26,144 --> 00:01:28,274
(Questioner) No, they do not.

19
00:01:28,274 --> 00:01:31,125
You need to live the way 
the squirrels live.

20
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:35,285
You are not even comparable 
to the squirrels.

21
00:01:35,285 --> 00:01:41,661
Things never turn out the way we wish 
because of so many differences in people.

22
00:01:41,661 --> 00:01:47,124
Over here people are like this, 
over there they are like that.

23
00:01:47,124 --> 00:01:53,183
The problem is not in the jobs 
but within yourself.

24
00:01:53,183 --> 00:01:58,464
It doesn't mean that all jobs are fine.
This is how the world is.

25
00:01:58,464 --> 00:02:02,344
This is how things work.

26
00:02:02,344 --> 00:02:07,503
America looks great from here. But, 
being in America, you see many problems.

27
00:02:07,503 --> 00:02:12,579
We seem to have many problems in Korea
but if they look at us from abroad,

28
00:02:12,579 --> 00:02:16,542
say from Vietnam or Cambodia,

29
00:02:16,542 --> 00:02:19,692
they will only see good things about us.

30
00:02:19,692 --> 00:02:23,806
If you were a teacher, 
you would see many corruptions

31
00:02:23,806 --> 00:02:25,866
in the educational system. 
A lot.

32
00:02:25,866 --> 00:02:30,845
If you were a Buddhist monk, you'd see 
many corruptions in the world of monks.

33
00:02:30,845 --> 00:02:31,782
A lot.

34
00:02:31,782 --> 00:02:32,720
(Audience Laughter)

35
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,595
Got it?

36
00:02:34,595 --> 00:02:39,415
If in the politics, you'd find 
many corruptions there, too.

37
00:02:39,415 --> 00:02:42,095
A lot.

38
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:48,623
So, wherever you look, you would 
find a lot of such contradictions.

39
00:02:48,623 --> 00:02:49,963
Got it?

40
00:02:49,963 --> 00:02:54,476
By acknowledging the problems

41
00:02:54,476 --> 00:02:57,706
But this doesn't mean that 
we do nothing about the troubles.

42
00:02:57,706 --> 00:03:03,054
We must do whatever we can 
to improve the situations.

43
00:03:03,054 --> 00:03:05,431
But you just notice the problems

44
00:03:05,431 --> 00:03:07,421
here, there and everywhere.

45
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:10,902
Because this world is so awful,

46
00:03:10,902 --> 00:03:12,723
if you were to become a Buddhist monk,

47
00:03:12,723 --> 00:03:16,333
you will not last 3 days at best.

48
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:19,566
You will see that 
things are wrong there, too.

49
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:22,904
This happens because of your own 
karmic tendency or your mind's habit.

50
00:03:22,904 --> 00:03:26,443
How many years at your current job?

51
00:03:26,443 --> 00:03:27,924
(Questioner) Only a few months.

52
00:03:27,924 --> 00:03:29,516
Only a few months?

53
00:03:29,516 --> 00:03:37,255
Then stay at this job for 3 years 
regardless whether you like or not.

54
00:03:37,255 --> 00:03:41,304
(Questioner) I don't change jobs in 
a matter of months. I do stay a while..

55
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:44,636
So, stay at the current job for 3 years.

56
00:03:44,636 --> 00:03:49,923
Not just stay put. For 3 years, you turn 
your judgmental thoughts back to yourself

57
00:03:49,923 --> 00:03:53,593
and you do this in a prayerful manner.

58
00:03:53,593 --> 00:03:57,903
You can quit after 3 years of noticing

59
00:03:57,903 --> 00:04:03,568
that it is you who raise 
the judgmental thoughts

60
00:04:03,568 --> 00:04:07,088
when a variety of things occur.

61
00:04:07,088 --> 00:04:14,051
It is your judgmental thoughts 
that are the problems everywhere.

62
00:04:14,051 --> 00:04:16,294
Are you married? 
(Questioner) No.

63
00:04:16,294 --> 00:04:18,885
You must not get married in this state.

64
00:04:18,885 --> 00:04:24,764
No matter how great a man seems 
before marriage,

65
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:27,844
you would see flaws after a while.
Got it?

66
00:04:27,844 --> 00:04:32,464
A guy may spit when he talks,
another one may stink,

67
00:04:32,464 --> 00:04:37,084
another guy may not wash his feet,
another one may not change clothes,

68
00:04:37,084 --> 00:04:42,285
There will be numerous problems.

69
00:04:42,285 --> 00:04:48,073
Don't think of this only as your problem.
Take this on as subject of your practice.

70
00:04:48,073 --> 00:04:54,014
No matter what sort of problem arises,
do not blame others.

71
00:04:54,014 --> 00:05:00,174
Realize your judgmental thoughts.
Become aware of your own thoughts.

72
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:03,924
Stick to your job for 3 years.

73
00:05:03,924 --> 00:05:06,445
(Questioner) May I ask you one question? 
(Sunim) Yes.

74
00:05:06,445 --> 00:05:13,573
(Questioner) You said that we live
simply like a squirrel or other animals.

75
00:05:13,573 --> 00:05:19,200
(Questioner) I understood your point, but 
since humans can feel and think,

76
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:23,814
(Questioner) how can we live 
so simply and enjoy our lives

77
00:05:23,814 --> 00:05:26,933
(Questioner) like a squirrel?

78
00:05:26,933 --> 00:05:28,422
You are right.

79
00:05:28,422 --> 00:05:32,213
(Questioner) And in order to improve, 
we ought to

80
00:05:32,213 --> 00:05:37,554
But right now, you are not even 
at the level of the squirrels.

81
00:05:37,554 --> 00:05:41,484
You need to get on the same level 
as them at least.

82
00:05:41,484 --> 00:05:44,015
If you become at the level 
of the squirrels,

83
00:05:44,015 --> 00:05:48,165
Or as for getting 
to a higher level than they.

84
00:05:48,165 --> 00:05:51,776
Do squirrels help their neighbors 
in trouble or not?

85
00:05:51,776 --> 00:05:53,506
They do not.

86
00:05:53,506 --> 00:05:56,165
If you want to be a higher level 
than the squirrels,

87
00:05:56,165 --> 00:05:58,464
the squirrels are also not very unhappy.

88
00:05:58,464 --> 00:06:00,694
But you are not very happy.

89
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:03,225
(Questioner) I am not unhappy.

90
00:06:03,225 --> 00:06:05,644
But you make conflicts with others,
don't you?

91
00:06:05,644 --> 00:06:07,694
To be in conflicts with others 
causes pain.

92
00:06:07,694 --> 00:06:11,073
Doesn't that make you unhappy? 
Aren't you troubled by the thoughts

93
00:06:11,073 --> 00:06:14,296
such as," why is that person doing that?"

94
00:06:14,296 --> 00:06:16,320
"how can he be like that, etc?"

95
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,831
That is being lower than the squirrels.

96
00:06:19,831 --> 00:06:24,155
Some people live worse than the squirrels,
some live at the level of the squirrels,

97
00:06:24,155 --> 00:06:26,895
and some live at the higher level.

98
00:06:26,895 --> 00:06:29,656
But you are living 
below the level of squirrels right now.

99
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:34,336
So, I am using a squirrel's life 
as a benchmark.

100
00:06:34,336 --> 00:06:40,260
If you were living as well 
as a squirrel free of problems

101
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:44,145
or even with problems,

102
00:06:44,145 --> 00:06:47,955
if you were not burdened by them, 
and then asked me if this is all in life,

103
00:06:47,955 --> 00:06:51,125
I'd say no.

104
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:55,515
I am saying that 
even squirrels can live as well.

105
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:58,527
Then if you ask how do I live better?

106
00:06:58,527 --> 00:07:01,411
You ought to be able 
to help others in distress.

107
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:06,946
Even when you're hungry if you see 
another hungry, you share your food.

108
00:07:06,946 --> 00:07:11,474
You ought to live a life 
that can be helpful to others.

109
00:07:11,474 --> 00:07:16,355
Living engrossed in your own discomfort
is living a life below the squirrel.

110
00:07:16,355 --> 00:07:23,314
Sharing your happiness with others is 
living a life better than a squirrel.

111
00:07:23,314 --> 00:07:29,094
I am telling you to live like a squirrel 
since you lives lower than squirrel does.

112
00:07:29,094 --> 00:07:34,285
Ask me again when you live like a squirrel
Tell you how to live better.

113
00:07:34,285 --> 00:07:38,344
The animals have feelings

114
00:07:38,344 --> 00:07:43,344
but they have no feelings of 
jealousy or envy.

115
00:07:43,344 --> 00:07:44,324
Got it?

116
00:07:44,324 --> 00:07:48,425
But they also do not have compassion 
to help others, either.

117
00:07:48,425 --> 00:07:52,066
But humans get jealous and competitive. 
In jealousy and competitions we fall

118
00:07:52,066 --> 00:07:54,654
beneath the level of even animals.

119
00:07:54,654 --> 00:07:58,584
Having compassion for others is being 
better than animals.

120
00:07:58,584 --> 00:08:04,440
You ought to improve the aspects 
of yourself

121
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,676
that fall below the level of a squirrel.

122
00:08:07,676 --> 00:08:12,564
First, you ought to live as well as 
a squirrel at the very least.

123
00:08:12,564 --> 00:08:16,083
And then you can move onto a path that is 
better than that of the animals.

124
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:17,194
(Questioner) Thank you.

125
00:08:17,194 --> 00:08:20,435
Stick to your job for 3 years.

126
00:08:20,435 --> 00:08:27,025
(Questioner) I will think about it. 
(Audience Laughter)
