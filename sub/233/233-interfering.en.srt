00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,725
The Meaning of Not Interfering

2
00:00:04,051 --> 00:00:06,341
Among your talks, you mention that

3
00:00:06,341 --> 00:00:08,901
we ought not to interfere
in other people's lives.

4
00:00:08,901 --> 00:00:16,162
Thinking that "other people" 
as anyone other than myself,

5
00:00:16,162 --> 00:00:21,612
I tend to neglect my relationships
with other people.

6
00:00:21,612 --> 00:00:25,883
In that case, when and 
how do we use the word, family?

7
00:00:25,883 --> 00:00:28,181
Wouldn't I become too indifferent

8
00:00:28,181 --> 00:00:32,021
and give up on others
with this way of thinking?

9
00:00:32,021 --> 00:00:36,011
I would like to hear your thoughts
about this matter.

10
00:00:38,781 --> 00:00:43,932
When we say that 
we love our children,

11
00:00:43,932 --> 00:00:47,372
there are two kinds of 
meaning in that love.

12
00:00:47,372 --> 00:00:52,842
One can mean a real sacrifice
in order to help our children.

13
00:00:52,842 --> 00:00:55,931
The child is in the center, you
are secondary in importance.

14
00:00:55,931 --> 00:01:00,695
You call it love when you say that you
would do anything to help your child.

15
00:01:00,695 --> 00:01:04,555
But there in that statement, 
you are actually in the center

16
00:01:04,555 --> 00:01:06,545
and your child is secondary.

17
00:01:06,545 --> 00:01:11,764
You demand that 
the child follow your need.

18
00:01:11,764 --> 00:01:16,604
This is selfishness. 
This is your desire.

19
00:01:16,604 --> 00:01:19,794
This is not love.

20
00:01:19,794 --> 00:01:25,343
In Buddhism, we call this
obsessive attachment.

21
00:01:25,343 --> 00:01:31,099
So, the parents can cause 
harm to their children

22
00:01:31,099 --> 00:01:33,739
through this obsessive attachment.

23
00:01:33,739 --> 00:01:37,399
Instead of helping the children, 
parents harm the children.

24
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:41,456
So, I say, "Let go of your
obsessive attachment."

25
00:01:41,463 --> 00:01:43,463
When I say this, you say,

26
00:01:43,463 --> 00:01:48,003
"How can I let go of the attachment? 
He is my child!"

27
00:01:48,003 --> 00:01:50,133
Then, I say what?

28
00:01:50,133 --> 00:01:53,713
"Do not interfere 
in another person's life!"

29
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:56,807
This means, even though it's your child,

30
00:01:56,807 --> 00:02:01,157
you ought to respect 
the individual person in him.

31
00:02:01,157 --> 00:02:04,818
So, not interfering 
in other people's lives means,

32
00:02:04,818 --> 00:02:06,868
even though you are the parent,

33
00:02:06,868 --> 00:02:09,838
respect your child 
as an independent person.

34
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:12,828
Though he is your child, 
respect his own independent personhood.

35
00:02:12,828 --> 00:02:18,118
Though he is your husband, 
respect him as an independent person.

36
00:02:18,118 --> 00:02:19,978
Respect the individual's personhood.

37
00:02:19,978 --> 00:02:24,819
In the name of my child, 
my parents, my husband, my wife

38
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:30,860
we often do not respect 
the other's individual personhood.

39
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,989
So, I say: do not interfere
in other people's lives.

40
00:02:36,049 --> 00:02:41,380
Turn it upside down: 
respect the other's individuality.

41
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:45,584
Respect individuality.

42
00:02:46,724 --> 00:02:51,775
For example, you give birth to a child.

43
00:02:53,195 --> 00:02:58,920
The child goes to kindergarten to 
elementary school and middle school.

44
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,201
You have to take care 
of this child or not?

45
00:03:03,201 --> 00:03:05,631
"Well, go ahead and live your life"

46
00:03:05,631 --> 00:03:08,441
Would you say that
and leave the child alone?

47
00:03:08,441 --> 00:03:12,970
"The Sunim said that it's your life,"

48
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:17,763
"I'm not going to interfere in your life, 
enjoy your life"

49
00:03:17,763 --> 00:03:19,643
Would you say like this?

50
00:03:19,643 --> 00:03:21,702
That is not what I mean.

51
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:27,843
A young child needs to be 
taken care of by someone.

52
00:03:27,843 --> 00:03:30,683
So, a mother needs to 
take care of her child.

53
00:03:30,683 --> 00:03:34,413
Even a motherless child needs 
to be cared for. Right?

54
00:03:34,413 --> 00:03:37,923
It is necessary that someone
should care for the child.

55
00:03:37,933 --> 00:03:42,489
We name those who take care of the child 
as mothers or parents.

56
00:03:42,499 --> 00:03:45,839
So, you don't care for someone 
only because you gave birth to him

57
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:49,339
When you encounter a child who 
needs care, you take care of the child.

58
00:03:49,339 --> 00:03:51,919
It doesn't matter 
whether the child is yours or not.

59
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:55,835
Because it is the law of nature.

60
00:03:55,835 --> 00:04:01,636
But the child you are caring for
is growing to be an adolescent.

61
00:04:01,636 --> 00:04:03,967
What is the meaning of adolescence?

62
00:04:03,967 --> 00:04:11,405
Male physical characteristics appear
in boys and female ones for girls.

63
00:04:11,405 --> 00:04:16,597
Boys can have erections, 
and girls start developing breasts.

64
00:04:16,597 --> 00:04:22,458
Their bodies grow into those of adults.

65
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:26,478
As the bodies grow, 
their mental states, too, evolve

66
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:35,268
so that they become more self-centered 
and do things on their own.

67
00:04:35,268 --> 00:04:38,749
The child who always listened 
to his mom before,

68
00:04:38,749 --> 00:04:42,604
starts saying "No"

69
00:04:42,604 --> 00:04:44,923
He will do things in spite
of being told not to

70
00:04:44,923 --> 00:04:46,913
or not do the things 
he is told to do.

71
00:04:46,913 --> 00:04:49,504
So, the child begins to have 
conflict with his mother.

72
00:04:49,504 --> 00:04:52,094
Does this mean that the child 
has become a bad child?

73
00:04:52,094 --> 00:04:58,050
It is not that he has grown into
a bad child in the middle school.

74
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:01,540
This is a natural phenomenon.

75
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,770
So, what to do about this?

76
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:08,871
The child has done 
whatever he was told before,

77
00:05:08,871 --> 00:05:11,542
but now in order to make 
his own decisions,

78
00:05:11,542 --> 00:05:14,132
he needs to have his 
own experiences.

79
00:05:14,132 --> 00:05:17,083
He needs to experience making 
mistakes and getting hurt.

80
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,803
He may get hurt physically, too.

81
00:05:18,803 --> 00:05:25,132
It is a period when he learns to make 
his own decisions by his own experiences.

82
00:05:25,142 --> 00:05:30,533
During this time, 
a parent must hold your tongue

83
00:05:30,533 --> 00:05:34,263
even if you think he'd make a mistake.

84
00:05:34,263 --> 00:05:41,763
Even if he gets hurt, loses money, 
or gets hurt physically,

85
00:05:41,763 --> 00:05:47,089
watching the child go through those 
processes with cool detachment

86
00:05:47,089 --> 00:05:49,848
is the genuine love for the child.

87
00:05:49,848 --> 00:05:53,513
But a mother, 
focusing only on her feelings of

88
00:05:53,513 --> 00:05:56,633
not wanting to see 
her child get hurt,

89
00:05:56,633 --> 00:05:59,780
and out of the habit of caring for 
a small child,

90
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,110
keeps telling him what to do.

91
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:06,775
It's hard on the parents 
caring for the child,

92
00:06:06,775 --> 00:06:12,325
and the child loses the chance 
to experience things on his own.

93
00:06:12,325 --> 00:06:18,546
In the end, it will be 
a great loss for the child.

94
00:06:18,546 --> 00:06:22,025
You have created someone 
who is unable to live his own life.

95
00:06:22,025 --> 00:06:27,065
The parent will not know what to do.

96
00:06:27,065 --> 00:06:29,318
The kid will do what he will.

97
00:06:29,318 --> 00:06:31,366
According to whatever he thinks.

98
00:06:31,366 --> 00:06:38,566
Then, you need to step back 
with cool detachment.

99
00:06:38,566 --> 00:06:41,048
You help when the child asks for help.

100
00:06:41,048 --> 00:06:44,672
If his leg is broken and he asks to 
be taken to the hospital, you help.

101
00:06:44,672 --> 00:06:49,162
Otherwise, leave him alone 
when he gets something like scratches.

102
00:06:49,552 --> 00:06:54,978
So, when he comes asking for help, 
then you help.

103
00:06:54,978 --> 00:07:00,968
Even when he asks for help, 
you need to think things through.

104
00:07:00,968 --> 00:07:06,728
You must be detached,
so that the child can become independent.

105
00:07:06,728 --> 00:07:11,910
Moreover, when he becomes an adult, 
you need to cut the emotional ties.

106
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:16,291
If you interfere in his life 
just because he is your child

107
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:19,231
and bestowing a heavy 
burden on him,

108
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:21,480
he will not be able to 
grow up properly.

109
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,950
And it will be hard for you 
as well to interfere.

110
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:30,170
He will resist and push back. 
Then the conflict will be hard to handle.

111
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:33,781
When I listen carefully, though you think 
the problem is with the child,

112
00:07:33,781 --> 00:07:39,136
I see the problem is yours.

113
00:07:39,136 --> 00:07:43,366
So, I say, "Don't interfere 
in other people's lives."

114
00:07:43,366 --> 00:07:45,157
"You just live your life well."

115
00:07:45,177 --> 00:07:48,928
"Why are you interfering in other's life 
when you don't live well yourself?"

116
00:07:48,928 --> 00:07:51,072
So, when I say this, 
you may think that

117
00:07:51,072 --> 00:07:53,512
it is not in accordance 
with Buddha's teaching

118
00:07:53,512 --> 00:07:56,013
which says to think of 
all being as yourself

119
00:07:56,013 --> 00:07:58,523
or look upon them with 
great compassion, etc.

120
00:07:58,523 --> 00:08:01,103
I think your question comes
from these thoughts.

121
00:08:01,103 --> 00:08:05,604
It seems like you might 
misunderstood what I have said.

122
00:08:05,604 --> 00:08:11,774
In addition, when you are married,

123
00:08:11,774 --> 00:08:16,135
Do you think the husband must do 
100% of what the wife asks of him?

124
00:08:16,135 --> 00:08:20,735
Doesn't he have his own life even 
though he cooperates with the wife?

125
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,924
He surely has his own life.

126
00:08:22,924 --> 00:08:25,574
Same goes for you living 
with your husbands .

127
00:08:25,574 --> 00:08:28,196
You raise children, 
run the household,

128
00:08:28,196 --> 00:08:31,216
and do things in the incorporation 
with your husband.

129
00:08:31,216 --> 00:08:35,726
but you also come here to listen to 
the teachings and practice and so on.

130
00:08:35,726 --> 00:08:38,746
You also need to have your own life, no?
(Audience : Yes)

131
00:08:38,746 --> 00:08:42,231
Yet if your husband says 
you ought to stay home

132
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:44,891
or asks why you go to the temple,

133
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:49,021
Why volunteer when it doesn't
bring in any income, etc.

134
00:08:49,021 --> 00:08:52,737
If he points out all the things 
repeatedly, You won't have your own life.

135
00:08:52,737 --> 00:08:55,167
You can't live your life 
according to his wishes.

136
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:58,188
Eat when he tells you to eat,
stay home when he tells you to do.

137
00:08:58,188 --> 00:09:00,308
Are you able to live 
under such conditions?

138
00:09:00,308 --> 00:09:04,158
How do you stress out because of 
such things and often ask for advice?

139
00:09:04,158 --> 00:09:07,737
Likewise, husbands have 
their own lives too.

140
00:09:07,737 --> 00:09:13,619
You may not like what he does, 
but those are your thoughts.

141
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:16,639
He has his own thoughts, too.

142
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:23,921
Therefore, even though you live together, 
you ought to respect his individuality.

143
00:09:23,921 --> 00:09:27,090
I am not saying just leave him to do 
whatever he likes.

144
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:32,949
But you need to respect certain things 
such as his own beliefs or convictions.

145
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:36,129
But you only see from your perspective.

146
00:09:36,129 --> 00:09:37,815
"When the work is over,

147
00:09:37,815 --> 00:09:40,975
why did you go out for drinks 
instead of coming home straightly?"

148
00:09:40,975 --> 00:09:42,945
"Why did you meet your friends?"

149
00:09:42,945 --> 00:09:44,805
"Why you have to go to that funeral?"

150
00:09:44,805 --> 00:09:46,925
"Why did you help 
your friend with moving?"

151
00:09:46,925 --> 00:09:50,795
You are not working, so you only need to 
take care of home and family,

152
00:09:50,795 --> 00:09:57,131
But when you work, there are 
many social relationships.

153
00:09:57,131 --> 00:09:58,451
It's the same with me.

154
00:09:58,451 --> 00:10:02,452
For example, the priests, clergymen
and many others visit here

155
00:10:02,452 --> 00:10:04,632
during Buddha's Birthday event.

156
00:10:04,632 --> 00:10:08,023
You just notice that other 
religious leaders come to visit.

157
00:10:08,023 --> 00:10:09,473
And you may think that's all.

158
00:10:09,473 --> 00:10:14,824
But for me, I have to return
the favors, don't I?

159
00:10:14,824 --> 00:10:19,523
So, I get busier during Christmas days
than I am on Buddha's birthday.

160
00:10:19,523 --> 00:10:21,603
(Audience Laughter)

161
00:10:21,603 --> 00:10:23,034
If three clergymen came here,

162
00:10:23,034 --> 00:10:25,924
how many churches do I have to visit
on Christmas?

163
00:10:25,924 --> 00:10:28,875
I have to visit three churches.

164
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:33,464
If two priests came, 
I have to go to two cathedrals.

165
00:10:33,464 --> 00:10:37,615
Since the catholics and the protestants 
celebrate the same Christmas,

166
00:10:37,615 --> 00:10:40,700
how many places 
do I need to go? Five

167
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:44,290
Three places on the 25th,

168
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:48,476
and two places on Christmas eve.

169
00:10:48,476 --> 00:10:53,727
Nothing is free in this world.

170
00:10:53,727 --> 00:10:57,616
You just donate money but in my 
case, I can't do that with money.

171
00:10:57,616 --> 00:11:05,766
When a guest pays me a visit for our 
special event, I have to attend his event.

172
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:09,847
Otherwise, the relationship 
will discontinue.

173
00:11:09,847 --> 00:11:14,077
That's why I get busy.

174
00:11:14,077 --> 00:11:17,928
But those who don't have such 
relationships wonder why I do such things

175
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:20,817
"Why does a buddhist monk
go to church on Christmas?"

176
00:11:20,817 --> 00:11:23,500
They may think this but that is
not how the world works.

177
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,019
I would have to give up the interfaith 
relationships if I didn't do that.

178
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:29,219
Do you understand what I mean?

179
00:11:29,219 --> 00:11:35,410
And so you should not think
about your perspective only.

180
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:43,044
Other people have lives and
relationships that do not include you.

181
00:11:43,044 --> 00:11:48,193
Knowing this, if you saw your parents 
arguing a lot when you were a child,

182
00:11:48,193 --> 00:11:52,820
and you tell me that you were 
wounded by that, what do I say?

183
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,890
I say, "What's that got to do with you?"

184
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:59,191
They are parents to you but they are 
a married couple to each other.

185
00:11:59,191 --> 00:12:03,111
You can see now as an adult that 
couples do argue, right? Yes, they do.

186
00:12:03,111 --> 00:12:06,231
"Even though I was hurt
when I was a child,

187
00:12:06,231 --> 00:12:10,451
I can see that 
married people can argue."

188
00:12:10,451 --> 00:12:12,702
"That is why my parents argued."

189
00:12:12,702 --> 00:12:14,562
"Since I was so young and immature,

190
00:12:14,562 --> 00:12:19,542
I just thought people shouldn't argue. 
Now I know that people do argue"

191
00:12:19,542 --> 00:12:22,982
Thinking this way, your childhood 
wound can disappear right away.

192
00:12:22,982 --> 00:12:28,983
This is why I say, "What does the 
couple's arguing have to do with you?"

193
00:12:28,983 --> 00:12:33,673
When your son and his wife argue, 
you have nothing to do with it, right?

194
00:12:33,673 --> 00:12:38,553
So, just watch them 
as a cow watches a chicken.

195
00:12:38,553 --> 00:12:41,383
If it's not easy, what to do?

196
00:12:41,383 --> 00:12:44,678
Quietly, leave the house.

197
00:12:44,678 --> 00:12:47,890
Come back after the argue is over.

198
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:51,748
If one party says this, just listen 
and say yes. Same with the other party.

199
00:12:51,748 --> 00:12:58,175
Don't comment on anything; 
just say yes, yes, sure.

200
00:12:58,175 --> 00:13:00,646
Just go along with things this way.

201
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:06,155
You should not get involved deeply
and take someone's side.

202
00:13:06,155 --> 00:13:09,575
That is how I just listen to your woes.

203
00:13:09,575 --> 00:13:14,025
Even when you cry and
badmouth your husbands.

204
00:13:14,025 --> 00:13:18,195
(Audience Laughter)

205
00:13:18,195 --> 00:13:24,496
You should not get involved 
in other people's' lives that much.

206
00:13:24,496 --> 00:13:29,269
It won't be helpful to them 
and it will only distress you.
