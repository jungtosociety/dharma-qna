00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,060
I Want to Change My Habit of Procrastination

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:09,282
I have a problem of procrastinating
with everything I do.

3
00:00:09,282 --> 00:00:13,187
I tend to put things off 
till the last minute.

4
00:00:13,187 --> 00:00:16,060
It was more or less okay 
when I was in college.

5
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:22,601
Now I started a work and step into 
a real life, I realize it is not good.

6
00:00:22,601 --> 00:00:26,120
My effort to change doesn't really work.

7
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:31,652
Even the effort to change gets put off, 
so I feel rather lazy.

8
00:00:31,652 --> 00:00:37,380
I feel the inner conflict about this.

9
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:43,831
Yes, you could just accept the loss.

10
00:00:43,831 --> 00:00:48,530
You are still able to get along without 
the change. That is why you can't change.

11
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:53,990
You think that you may lose something but

12
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:57,391
in your subconscious mind, 
you feel, "It's not that bad."

13
00:00:57,391 --> 00:01:01,861
So, a person who can't quit smoking 
thinks that he should quit.

14
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:04,970
He knows that it is bad for his health,

15
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:07,950
but in his subconscious mind,

16
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:11,870
"smoking isn't going to kill me. 
Or what if I die!"

17
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:15,071
He rationalizes his smoking habit.

18
00:01:15,071 --> 00:01:20,200
This is because he has lived 
a long time with this habit.

19
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,860
It has become a habit.

20
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:31,261
Procrastination has become your habit.
Your habits control your mind.

21
00:01:31,261 --> 00:01:37,099
It's not easy to change 
because it has become a habit.

22
00:01:37,099 --> 00:01:42,075
So, just live with this habit and 
accept the losses.

23
00:01:42,075 --> 00:01:48,941
But, if you decide that the losses are 
too big, and are causing harm to you,

24
00:01:48,941 --> 00:01:51,990
you must change no matter 
how old the habit is.

25
00:01:51,990 --> 00:02:04,140
No matter how long he has smoked, he 
needs to quit. But it will be difficult.

26
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,261
Have you finished college?
(Questioner) Yes

27
00:02:09,261 --> 00:02:11,370
Then you should know.

28
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,129
Let's say, here is an object.

29
00:02:13,129 --> 00:02:16,870
What is the property of this object?

30
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:22,849
Among its properties, when an object 
is at rest, it continues to rest.

31
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:27,991
when it is in motion, 
it continues to move.

32
00:02:27,991 --> 00:02:30,021
Did you learn that in high school?
(Questioner) Yes I did.

33
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:34,389
What is the law?

34
00:02:34,389 --> 00:02:36,510
(Questioner) It's the law of inertia.

35
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:40,181
I guess you did go to high school.
(Audience Laughter)

36
00:02:40,181 --> 00:02:42,840
It's the law of inertia.

37
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:49,770
An object at rest will remain at rest, 
and an object in motion continues in motion.

38
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,751
This law of inertia applies to all things.

39
00:02:52,751 --> 00:02:55,871
So, if you want to move an object at rest,

40
00:02:55,871 --> 00:02:58,599
Do you need to apply force 
or will it move by itself?

41
00:02:58,599 --> 00:02:59,859
(Questioner) I have to apply force.

42
00:02:59,859 --> 00:03:04,082
To stop a moving object, will it stop 
by itself or should you apply force?

43
00:03:04,082 --> 00:03:06,090
(Questioner) Apply force.
(Sunim) Yes.

44
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:11,019
Moving an object at rest 
or stopping one in motion,

45
00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:13,911
means that the speed has changed.

46
00:03:13,911 --> 00:03:19,060
So, the force changes the speed, 
we call it acceleration, right?

47
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:24,440
What is the relationship between 
the applied force and acceleration?

48
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,940
(Questioner)
Inverse proportion

49
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,000
No, They're in a 
proportional relationship.

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,370
We express this as: F=MA, right?

51
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:35,611
This is the second law of motion: 
the law of acceleration.

52
00:03:35,611 --> 00:03:41,309
So, the law of inertia is the first, the 
law of the acceleration is the second law

53
00:03:41,309 --> 00:03:45,090
The third law is action and reaction.

54
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:49,020
These are Newton's laws of motion, right?

55
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:54,149
So, the law of inertia 
applies in our lives, too.

56
00:03:54,149 --> 00:03:57,679
A smoker will continue to want to smoke.

57
00:03:57,679 --> 00:04:05,660
In this case, the law of inertia 
applies to continuing-smoking

58
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:10,510
The law of inertia is at work. 
You continue to procrastinate.

59
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:16,419
So, if you want to stop something, 
what needs to happen?

60
00:04:16,419 --> 00:04:18,030
You have to apply force.

61
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:23,991
The force of wanting to quit 
needs to be applied.

62
00:04:23,991 --> 00:04:28,211
So, the force has to be applied 
to this object.

63
00:04:28,211 --> 00:04:32,750
If only a minor force is applied, 
will it move or not?

64
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,951
It won't move even if you do it ten times.

65
00:04:34,951 --> 00:04:36,960
What needs to be done?

66
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,730
You have to apply force that is 
greater than its frictional force.

67
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:44,570
Can you apply it just once and let go, 
or do you continue applying the force?

68
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:46,191
(Questioner) 
You have to continue

69
00:04:46,191 --> 00:04:52,050
So, there are two things: you have to 
apply force strong enough to move it.

70
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:58,100
and the force needs to persist 
to move an object at rest.

71
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:03,380
So if you want to change your 
habit of procrastination,

72
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:10,489
you need to have the determination 
strong enough to overcome the resistance.

73
00:05:10,489 --> 00:05:18,530
And you need to persist in order to 
move away from procrastination.

74
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:20,430
Let's say, here's some water.

75
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:25,570
If I insert a hose where it's higher 
and point it to lower,

76
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:28,411
the water should flow down
naturally, right?

77
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:32,660
But it won't unless you siphon it.

78
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:35,960
Why?

79
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:42,781
There is a barrier over the water 
surface so it can't flow over.

80
00:05:42,781 --> 00:05:50,311
It will flow over only if you 
siphon it to go over the top.

81
00:05:50,311 --> 00:05:53,922
If you siphon it to come up 
only this high over and over,

82
00:05:53,922 --> 00:05:56,600
even if you do it 300 times,
will it flow over the top?

83
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,669
(Questioner) No, it won't.
No, it won't. "Resolutions last 3 days."

84
00:05:59,669 --> 00:06:01,920
To make the water flow over,

85
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:06,470
you have to siphon it 
hard enough to flow over the top.

86
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:07,840
Do you understand?

87
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:13,911
So, you can just go on living as you are, 
just putting things off

88
00:06:13,911 --> 00:06:17,597
and accept the consequences.

89
00:06:17,597 --> 00:06:20,361
In short, live according to your karma.

90
00:06:20,361 --> 00:06:25,410
or, if you want to change, you have to 
fight against your own resistance.

91
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:30,243
Up till now, you have tried a bit 
and stopped and tried and stopped,

92
00:06:30,243 --> 00:06:31,900
so your efforts have failed.

93
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:37,471
You must exert greater effort and 
persist for a long while.

94
00:06:37,471 --> 00:06:42,021
So, if you really want to overcome it, 
write it down.

95
00:06:42,021 --> 00:06:45,099
Don't try to do it all at once.

96
00:06:45,099 --> 00:06:49,469
Regardless of what the work is, once you 
decide to do something, never postpone it.

97
00:06:49,469 --> 00:06:54,111
Even if you have to stay up all night, 
get it done.

98
00:06:54,111 --> 00:06:56,770
If you continue in this fashion,

99
00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:03,480
for a month, 3 months, a year, then, 
the habits will change.

100
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,260
Try that.

101
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:10,450
If you put your life on the line, 
you can overcome it.

102
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:14,160
It's not working because 
you give up easily when it gets hard,

103
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,168
thinking, 
"Do I really have to work so hard at it?"

104
00:07:18,168 --> 00:07:21,438
When Buddha sat under the bodhi tree,

105
00:07:21,438 --> 00:07:26,531
he had an absolute resolve.
"I am willing to die."

106
00:07:26,531 --> 00:07:31,780
"I won't get up until I reach enlightenment, 
and I am willing to die for it."

107
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:36,211
You need this kind of resolve 
to overcome your mara (hindrances).

108
00:07:36,211 --> 00:07:42,111
A smoker wanting to quit, 
after a few days of trying,

109
00:07:42,111 --> 00:07:47,510
his desire will increase to the 
point of getting physical pain.

110
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:51,290
His pain will change his thinking.

111
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:54,821
His reason for quitting was 
for his health, right?

112
00:07:54,821 --> 00:08:00,130
But, it defeats the purpose 
if it causes him physical pain.

113
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:04,472
So, he thinks that he'd be better off 
going back to smoke.

114
00:08:04,472 --> 00:08:09,860
When the pain gets worse, he thinks,
"what's the point of quitting?"

115
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:12,761
"What's the point of living a long life?
I should just smoke and die."

116
00:08:12,761 --> 00:08:15,900
His mind changes like this 
and rationalizes.

117
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:21,810
Because, as I said before, there is a natural 
tendency of doing what it is doing.

118
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:28,979
So, this habit is hard to change.
The resistance to change is strong.

119
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:33,969
So, he gives up by changing his mind 
in the end.

120
00:08:33,969 --> 00:08:38,449
We tend to rationalize ourselves 
when we examine ourselves carefully.

121
00:08:38,449 --> 00:08:43,700
We call it mara in our practice. 
The devil's obstruction so to speak.

122
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:48,750
We don't mean it's evil. It just means 
it gets in our way of practice.

123
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,819
It's not just you. It happens to everyone.

124
00:08:51,819 --> 00:08:55,830
So, we have saying: 
Resolutions last 3 days.

125
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:59,869
Any habit that's formed at a young age is 
very hard to change.

126
00:08:59,869 --> 00:09:03,761
That's why we say, 
"You can't change your inborn nature".

127
00:09:03,761 --> 00:09:07,580
Or, when someone does change, 
we say, "He's going to die soon".

128
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,650
These show how difficult it is to change.

129
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,910
Since it's that difficult, 
what did people say in the old days?

130
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:17,167
It's your destiny, people used to say.

131
00:09:17,167 --> 00:09:19,851
"God made you this way"

132
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:24,861
"It's from your past life; 
it's your destiny."

133
00:09:24,861 --> 00:09:28,120
It shows how difficult it is to change.

134
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:36,240
But Buddha said: All is impermanent. 
There is nothing that does not change.

135
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,830
Only, it is hard to change.

136
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:43,189
Human beings lack the willpower to change

137
00:09:43,189 --> 00:09:46,879
so we say things like that.

138
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:52,020
Buddha was the first to break through it.

139
00:09:52,020 --> 00:10:00,070
So don't assume that 
it's hard to change your little habit.

140
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:06,020
If you really want to change, 
do it with a strong resolve.

141
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:10,140
The reason I told you to 
stay the way you are was

142
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:15,120
because if you try and quit, try and quit
you will end up tormenting yourself.

143
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,301
You will torture yourself thinking 
you are a worthless person.

144
00:10:20,301 --> 00:10:26,990
In that case, 
it's better to go on as you are.

145
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:31,331
(Questioner) Thank you.
(Audience Applause)

146
00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:33,471
No...hold the microphone,
So what will you do?

147
00:10:33,471 --> 00:10:39,860
After listening to me, did you decide to 
change or stay the way you are?

148
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,560
I will try to change.

149
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:46,060
When you're trying to change, 
don't say things like,"It's no use."

150
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:49,460
You must tackle it with 
your willingness to die for it.

151
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:56,970
In order to change, you may stay up 
all night or could get sick the next day.

152
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:59,620
I go around giving 
300 scheduled lectures these days.

153
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:03,053
Do you think I always feel well 
or sometimes I get sick?

154
00:11:03,053 --> 00:11:05,970
There are days when I am sick…

155
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:10,179
There are days I feel like I'm dying. 
Sometimes I really want to take a day off.

156
00:11:10,179 --> 00:11:17,071
But, since I promised, 
I do it even if I might collapse and die.

157
00:11:17,071 --> 00:11:19,911
I overcome the mara by thinking that

158
00:11:19,911 --> 00:11:23,801
it would be an honorable death,
if I die while lecturing.

159
00:11:23,801 --> 00:11:27,099
Otherwise, I would quit
in the middle of it.

160
00:11:27,099 --> 00:11:30,300
So, when you make a decision 
to do something, just do it.

161
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:36,540
Don't make excuses of any kind. 
Otherwise, your habit will hinder you.

162
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:41,171
There are two ways to overcome your habit.

163
00:11:41,171 --> 00:11:47,061
A long term plan is for you to get up at 
5 a.m. every morning and pray.

164
00:11:47,061 --> 00:11:49,020
Would it be easy or hard?

165
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,040
(Questioner) It would be hard.

166
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:57,180
Which would be easier? 
Doing that or changing your habit?

167
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:01,380
Get into the habit of getting up at 5:00 
every morning to pray.

168
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:05,980
even when you're sick, when it rains, 
when visitors come, when you travel.

169
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:09,011
Do this for 100 days without skipping.

170
00:12:09,011 --> 00:12:14,370
If you can do that, you can change 
other things about yourself, too.

171
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:20,720
If it's too hard and you are skipping, 
there is another way.

172
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:28,601
Take three days off and 
come to the temple and do 10,000 bows.

173
00:12:28,601 --> 00:12:31,501
After the 10,000 bows, 
108 bows will be easy, right?

174
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:33,441
(Questioner) It would be easy.
Very easy.

175
00:12:33,441 --> 00:12:41,452
Your hinderance will disappear while 
you're doing the 10,000 prostrations.

176
00:12:41,452 --> 00:12:46,291
Are you willing to take on this challenge 
to change your habit, or not? You are not.

177
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:50,250
That is why you can't change.

178
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:55,770
So, starting tomorrow morning, 
get up at 5 a.m. and do 108 prostrations.

179
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:57,986
What if you went to bed at 4 a.m.?

180
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:02,680
You still get up at 5 and do the bows 
even if you go back to sleep afterwards.

181
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,211
Understand?

182
00:13:04,211 --> 00:13:13,220
If you can't keep this up, come to the
temple and do the 10,000 prostrations.

183
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:17,003
Even if you feel like dying, just do it.
You will really feel like dying.

184
00:13:17,003 --> 00:13:20,661
So, bow down and see you're dead. 
If you're not dead, then get up.

185
00:13:20,661 --> 00:13:23,941
If you're not dead standing, 
bow down again.

186
00:13:23,941 --> 00:13:26,021
If you are willing to die, 
you can do this.

187
00:13:26,021 --> 00:13:31,044
Then eventually, you would have 
finished 10,000 bows. Okay?

188
00:13:31,044 --> 00:13:34,212
That's how you overcome yourself.

189
00:13:34,212 --> 00:13:43,361
If not, as a young man, why would you 
go on living as you do now?

190
00:13:43,361 --> 00:13:46,911
(Questioner) Thank you.
